		<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is often said that beauty is only skin deep. But regardless of age, every woman wishes for clear and radiant skin. But there are several apprehensions that are associated with bleaching. The</span><b> best skin bleach for your dark spots</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Rupini’s gives you the right idea regarding skin bleaching and also its pros and cons.</span></p>
<h4><b>What exactly is skin bleaching?</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-376 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1r4QzToYez.jpg" alt="best skin bleach for your dark spots " width="968" height="1000" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin bleaching is also known as skin whitening or skin lightening. It is usually a chemical process to reduce the concentration of melanin on the face or other parts of the body. It fades your skin tone beyond your natural complexion. As it fades the skin complexion, it also latent the facial hair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several methods as to which you can remove your facial hair. Waxing, threading, laser hair removal, epilating, plucking etc.  Rupini’s are here to tell you the advantages of skin bleaching over other techniques. We offer the </span><b><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/skin-bleaching">best bleach for your dark spots</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and facial hair. </span></p>
<h4><b>Benefits of </b><b>bleaching your skin</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-375 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Q8O3s7IMZH.jpg" alt="best skin bleach for your dark spots " width="1000" height="418" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives an instant brightness to your skin.  The chemicals used in the bleach lightens the facial hair to a golden hue and renders an instant glow to your face.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It saves you the pain of threading. As we all you know, threading is a bit painful. So bleaching conceals the dark unwanted facial hair.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bleaching makes pigmentation marks appear lighter. As the bleach lightens the face, pigmentation and blemishes also appear lighter. It also removes tan and gets rid of uneven skin.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A smooth, soft and glowing skin at the end of the day. The bleach not only lightens and hides the facial hair. It also removes unnecessary blackheads and whiteheads that give you smooth and soft skin.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Some flaws that can occur while </b><b>bleaching your skin</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the two sides of a coin, </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore"><b>bleaching your skin</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also has its own cons. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chemical process. The fact that bleaching is a chemical process is itself unfavourable for several people. Most of them prefer to stay away from chemicals. Chemical ingredients like sodium hypochlorite might prove harmful to some skin types.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is your skin type? If you are someone with very sensitive skin, then it is better you think before you do bleaching. Bleaching is usually quite strong. So, it can become allergic to people with sensitive skin. Hence, it is always advisable to test your skin type before you venture into </span><b>bleaching your skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not expose yourself to sun. Another important facet when it comes to bleaching is that you have to stay indoors after bleaching. Exposing your skin to the sun immediately after bleaching can damage your skin. If you can’t avoid going out, then you must definitely wear sunscreen. Or cover your face with a scarf or hat. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tingling sensations. </span><b>Bleaching your skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a bit tingling initially. There can also be slight irritations and itching sensations. However,  this tingling and sensation are quite normal.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it is highly advisable that you take a professional aid to do the bleaching unless it is a natural technique that you employ. Natural methods are time-consuming. Chemical bleaching can give you quicker and faster results. And also with skilled technicians can advise you with other requirements needed for your face and skin.</span></p>
<h4><b>Rupini’s with the </b><b>best facial bleach kit</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-377 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iUm0hzyU3f.jpg" alt="best skin bleach for your dark spots " width="1000" height="665" /></p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>What is threading?</b></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyebrow threading or shaping is an ancient technique believed to be originated in India. Threading is a natural method of removing unwanted hairs not only of the eyebrows but anywhere on the face. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/eyebrow-threading-singapore"><b>Eyebrow shaping Singapore</b> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers a full face threading because it is the safest approach even for sensitive skin, unlike waxing.  The full face threading at Rupini’s include:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheek.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Face threading versus waxing</b></h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/services"><b>Eyebrow threading</b> <b>Tampines</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is here to clear a clear picture of the difference between threading and waxing. First of all, as mentioned before, shaping your eyebrows by threading is the safest method than waxing.  Though threading and waxing serve the same purpose, threading is a natural substitution to waxing.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threading is suitable even for sensitive skin.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also more hygiene compared to waxing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threading takes away hair from the follicles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No chemicals or heat are involved in threading.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threading, on the other hand, works faster and lasts longer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No redness, rashness and other irritations with threading.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Professional threading versus self-threading</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SyaoWfv70v.jpg" alt="Eyebrow threading singapore" width="1000" height="668" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><b>Eyebrow threading Yishun </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is here to enlighten you with certain tips related to professional threading and self- threading. </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not try it at home. Threading is not a child’s play. Attempting to doing it at home is at your own risk. Especially in case of upper lip threading.  It always requires a professional to bring precision in threading. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technique and skill. Great patience and skill are required to thread off the finest hair from delicate skin. You might even end up with undesired results if done by unskilled hands.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before care and aftercare. A great amount of care is required before and after threading. The gentle skin above your eyes needs to be treated like that of a baby’s skin. You need to moisten the portion before the threading. And after threading, you must not touch the threaded portion and also avoid heavy makeup. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaping your eyebrows like a professional. Looking at a mirror and deciding an eyebrow shape all for yourself can go wrong. Professional makeup artists can tell you what eyebrow shape suits you according to the shape of your face. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shape of our eyebrows is also as unique as our fingerprint and tongue print. Therefore, the shape of the eyebrows is directly proportional to the shape of your face. Eyebrows, in fact, can enhance the beauty and charm of your face.</span><b> Eyebrow shaping Singapore</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lists done some basic shapes of eyebrows. Depending on the shape of your face, you can choose your eyebrow shape or we will help you select the perfect shape for your face. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-shaped eyebrows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard angled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft angled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Straight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rounded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, if you have a round face, as stylists we would advise you to keep a hard angled or soft angled shape to make your face look lengthier. If you are someone with a lean face, rounded eyebrows would make your face more round like. And the S-shaped eyebrows are perfect for an oval face. Highly arched S-shaped brows can bring out the elegance of your face.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>How the </b><b>eyebrow threading Singapore </b><b>at Rupini’s gives its best </b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rupini’s can proudly claim that we give the best threading services. We make use of </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong><i>best deep cleansing facial in Singapore</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great rejuvenating experience for everyone.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey beauty lovers!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 has started its course. We are getting older, there&#8217;s no denying that. We all love to stay young but the thing is that we can&#8217;t stay young forever. But you know what?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the best skincare from a reputed </span><b>beauty salon Singapore</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is all you have to do to look young.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know that the skin is the largest external organ in the human body?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know how the skin protects us from external factors like pathogens, heat, cold, UV rays, and more. By giving your skin the care it needs, it will take care of you in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that beauty care was a subject of research ever since ancient times?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per Wikipedia, the history of using cosmetics began around 7000 years ago.</span></p>
<h4><b>Don’t you think the skin requires a little care?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely. To get long-lasting advantages, it is ideal to do skincare on a periodic basis. Ever wondered why some people look young even in their fifties. Although there are many factors behind it, skincare is one among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can take care of your skin in two ways. The first one is by opting for natural remedies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second one is opting the services of the </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><b>best salon in Singapore</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To get the best results for your skin, it is wise to choose the second option.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the natural remedies include:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washing your face with warm water</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding long showers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using sunscreen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the right amount of sleep</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">beauty salons</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that provide different kinds of services for skincare. But it&#8217;s recommended to go for the ones that have well-trained staff and reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some common skincare procedures include </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore"><b>facial package Singapore</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, skin bleaching &amp; more. Most beauty salons offer these services. But it is important to get them done from a reputed one.</span></p>
<h4><b>Why Skincare is important</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-346 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/soUzwKLMzK-1.jpg" alt="beauty salon Singapore" width="1000" height="714" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do we bathe?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get rid of impurities, dirt, oil etc. The same case applies for the skin. After all, it is a part of our body that protects us from harmful diseases, UV rays etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the skin becomes exposed every time we step outside, dirt, dust, oils get accumulated on the skin. This, in turn, blocks the pores. If the skin is not cleaned, it becomes unhealthy and will cause problems. This includes skin reddening, itching, dryness, and other types of issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human skin type generally falls under four categories which are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oily</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combination</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different skin types need the right methods to improve appearance, texture &amp; smoothness. It is important for you to know your skin type if you plan on doing anything on the skin. The wrong procedure affects the skin in a  bad way. It leads to breakage, pH imbalance and results in more serious consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, it is important to apply the right procedure to the skin to avoid accidental damage to the skin. As mentioned earlier, there are many</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">beauty parlours</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that offer services for skincare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there are natural remedies that you can do yourselves, it is better to go to a reputed beauty salon. This helps in achieving the best results. With better technologies, different skincare methods are now available. All these methods make the skin softer, smoother &amp; free from wrinkles, pimples, acne.</span></p>
<h4><b>How to choose the best parlour?</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-347" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/v7yWD1glPe.jpg" alt="beauty salon singapore" width="1000" height="562" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the desired beauty service is easy. But choosing the right beauty salon is not that easy. When choosing one, it is ideal to know more about them. By checking online reviews, visiting their websites, etc can help you find the best one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or we can suggest the best one for you if you prefer the faster way. And it is Rupinis.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is around the corner. Wouldn’t you like to look stunning and feel special on this beautiful day? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><b>facial hair waxing and facial spa Singapore</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is at your disposition to give you the finest facial treatment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several apprehensions attributed to waxing and hence everyone gives a second thought to it. Will the waxing hurt my skin? Will the waxed hair grow back thicker? Are the basic concerns.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rupini’s the </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore"><b>best deep cleansing facial Singapore</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is here to cleanse both your concerns and also your facial hair.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>All that you need to know</b> <b>about facial and face waxing</b></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-340 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5kkJxGR5MI.jpg" alt="facial hair waxing and facial spa Singapore" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waxing or hair removal is not a new discovery or a current trend. It has a long history dating back to the Egyptians. Having facial hair for both men and women was considered uncivilized. Not only the Egyptians but the Persians, Romans and Europeans also had similar observances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/services"><b>facial treatment Singapore</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is here to tell you some aspects related to waxing.</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying your skin type. Before you decide to do facial waxing, you need to know your skin type and then able to choose the right waxing method.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say no to double Dipping. Double-dipping can really harm your skin. You ought to make sure that new spatulas are dipped before waxing to avoid post-waxing breakouts.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redness and rashness post-waxing. The skin of our face is comparatively thinner and sensitive than the rest of the body. Hence the redness after waxing is quite natural and phenomenal. But there are high chances to develop rashness and other irritations if the concoctions are not natural or if there is a large number of chemicals used.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No pain, no gain. As mentioned earlier, the skin of the face is very delicate. So it can hurt a little. However natural methods can relieve you of the pain. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long will it last? This is a debatable question when it comes to waxing and hair removal. Depending on the intensity and thickness of your facial hair and also the method you follow will decide how long will the waxing last. Waxing lasts when compared to other methods of removal.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not try it on your own. Experimenting facial waxing on your own can be a bit risky. Unless you are an expert in doing, it is advisable to approach a professional to get the waxing done.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking all these into consideration, the techniques for waxing employed by the</span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-spa-Singapore"><b> face waxing Singapore </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are traditional and natural.</span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Best extraction facial in Singapore for smooth glowing skin</b></h4>

The premium hard wax leaves your skin gentle and refreshing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bearing in mind the delicacy and sensitivity of the skin, we use only natural mixtures for waxing. Rupini utilises the naturalness of honey, oil and other anti-septic elements like natural turmeric. Once the waxing is done, rose water is daintily applied on the waxed portion to calm the pores and ease the irritation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hard waxing can prove advantageous as it prevents long-term damage to the skin like burning, scarring etc. moreover it takes away the hair from the roots and exfoliates the skin making it smoother at the end of the day. Besides, over the course of time, the hair gets weaker and reduces in further hair growth. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Affordable salon in Singapore &#8211; rupini&#8217;s &#8211; dicussing about <span style="color: #ff6600;">skin care</span>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skyrocketing pollution and stress levels, associated with the lifestyle tend to take a toll on your body and skin by prematurely ageing the faces of city dwellers, accelerating wrinkles and age spots. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are tons of topical creams in the market, nothing can rejuvenate your skin like a professional massage and well-advised skin therapies. So, ever wanted to see how beautiful you really are? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take years off your face and body? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best spa in Singapore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sharing some incredible tips to have that celebrity like face and skin.</span></p>
<h4><strong>The idea of skin rejuvenation sounds really appealing, isn’t it? But <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">which one do you choose ?</span></span> </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to skincare there is no “one golden rule”. And no single modality that can do everything. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your skin shows what’s happening internally and you have to pay attention to what you eat and how you live. No skin care technique is complete without making some lifestyle changes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a person’s face look young or old involves a number of variables like skin tone, texture, sagging, wrinkles, and loss of volume. The last three variables happen due to the lack of collagen production, which is considered as the structural support of your skin. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the beautification and rejuvenation techniques that involve going under the knife, now we have more natural, non-surgical and less invasive techniques that are taking a huge stride. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the popular treatments that are trending in skin rejuvenation</span></p>
<h4><b>Natural facelift facials</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Cleopatra to Kardashian, facials have been a secret of glowing skin for centuries now. Facials are known to be an ultimate life saver as it promises to turn back the clock by lifting jawline, eradicating lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-323 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/facial-tampanies.png" alt="facial in singapore" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a complete natural technique that specialises in keeping the structure of the face and neck synchronised, which involves bones, lymph, muscles, skin, connective tissue. It involves manual lymph drainage, promoting oxygenation and circulation which helps facial muscles and tissues.</span></p>
<h4><b>Body scrub and body polish</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who thought the scrubs are specifically for the face, we have a news for you. A body scrub is a popular treatment that exfoliates and hydrates your skin, leaving your skin smooth and soft.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-322 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore.png" alt="best parlour in Singapore" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is done using abrasive material like salt and sugar along with essential oils. A high-quality moisturizer is applied leaving the skin baby like.</span></p>
<h4><b>Body and face Massage</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to dermatologists, massaging the face and body at least once a month can do wonders for your skin. It helps the skin to get rid of the dirt, excess oil, and dead skin that accumulate on your skin giving a clean attractive and radiant appearance increasing circulation, skin tightening after weight loss or pregnancy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-327 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore.png" alt="massage in singapore" width="1000" height="750" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not just the skin, it also has some amazing health benefits like reducing puffiness, sinus pressure and fluid retention.</span></p>
<h4><b>Chemical peeling</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a technique where a chemical solution is used to remove damaged skin, which causes the outer layer of the skin to exfoliate and eventually to peel off. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-328" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/chemical-peeling-in-singapore.png" alt="chemical peel at home" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps to rejuvenate the skin and reveal the healthier looking skin underneath which often is smoother, less wrinkled and damaged.</span></p>
<h4><b>Microdermabrasion</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the non chemical and non invasive procedure that involves a special applicator with an abrasive surface, to sand away the thick outer layer of the skin and helps in skin rejuvenation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-325 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/skin-treatment-in-singapore.png" alt="skin care treatment in singapore" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is effective in exfoliating and removing dead skin layers and improving appearance of sun damage, wrinkles, fine lines, acne scarring, melasma and other skin related problems.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Isn’t beauty all about being comfortable in your own skin? Are you satisfied with the products you use? Being one of the best <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty salon</a> experts, here’s what we have got to share.</p>
<h1 style="display: none;"><b>&lt;&gt;Best Salon In Singapore</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the increased use of social media, people tend to hear a lot of opinions on how one is supposed to maintain your physical appearance. Nevertheless, taking care of your body is an important task and one to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beauty products play a major role in your day to day lives, be it for minor users to heavy users. Even for those who rarely look to products for their look, beauty products do in fact matter. And for this sole reason, choosing the right beauty products is key. But this is easier said than done.</p>
<h3>To help you choose the right products, here are some tips:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the various available beauty products in the market right now, choosing the right one seems to be a tedious task. You need to make sure that the product you buy brings out the best in you. A wasted investment is a no can do. Here are a few tips to help you choose your product:</p>
<p><b>1. GO FOR THE QUALITY BRANDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Money is something that needs to be spent carefully, but when it comes to self-care, don&#8217;t settle for less. Quality comes with a cost. Big brands come with a heavy price tag, but they guarantee results. Besides, products of poor quality pose threats to your body. So, the next time you hit the market make sure you buy one that you trust.</p>
<p><b>2. KNOW WHAT YOU NEED</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, your product needs to favor your body. So, before you buy, make sure that you’ve done your homework on what you need. Do not fall prey to cheap marketing schemes. Rather, do your research and make sure you are buying the right product for yourself.</p>
<p><b>3. ONLINE SHOPPING CAN WAIT</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People tend to buy things online due to the ease of access. But when it comes to beauty products, online shopping is not the best option. Online shopping sites are not 100% reliable. And even if they are, unless you have used the product before or at least have a clear idea about what product you are going to buy, shopping online can take the back seat. Heading out to your nearest shop and physically buying it gives you an idea on what you actually need.</p>
<p><b>4. LOOK FOR AN EXPERT OPINION</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your friends may have the best advice on everything else but when it comes to the right product, make sure you look for an expert opinion. Now, it doesn&#8217;t mean that this opinion needs to come from the best beauticians across the globe, it could just be an opinion from someone who knows exactly what each product does. This means it could be from the woman working in a nearby beauty parlour or <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty salon</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-302" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shutterstock-338483102-830x554-1.png" alt="Best Salon In Singapore " width="769" height="512" /></p>
<p>The idea is to make sure that you buy something that you are comfortable with. So, this may differ from person to person.<br />
Regardless, taking care of your skin is essential. Beauty products only act as a bonus. So, make sure you make sporadic visits to salons.<br />
Choosing the right <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">salon</a> or parlour is just as important. Your visits need to be worth your time. Luckily we have that covered for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking for some tips to maintain your skin smooth and flawless? Ideas on natural remedies that could keep your skin healthy and vibrant? Let’s take some advice from our experts on skin care.</span></p>
<h1 style="display: none;"><b>&lt;&gt;spa singapore</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all wish to maintain the texture and vibrancy of our skin opting for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore">facial treatment</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> packages in the market. With active skin control measures, we can ensure the health benefits that we add on treating your skin with the utmost importance and value.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/services"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-292 size-large" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/best-hair-stylist-for-short-hair-singapore-1024x576-1.jpg" alt="facial treatment singapore" width="1024" height="576" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>FACTORS THAT AFFECT YOUR SKIN</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several factors that diminish your chance of maintaining a smooth skin texture. You must be aware of the common reasons that cause the need to care for your skin before learning about the solutions in hand.</span></p>
<p><strong>DRYNESS OF SKIN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire area of concern revolves around the dryness of your skin that causes rough and cracked texture. Dry skin is characterized by tight and moderately rough skin consistency. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of the body commonly subjected to dryness or cracking must be usually hands, feet, and lips. The overall effect of this imbalance could cause a rooted malady in the long run.</span></p>
<p><strong>PRONENESS TO ACNE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frequent occurrence of acne will affect the smoothness of your skin texture by restricting the flawless and seamless nature of balance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving natural treatment plans for acne control will benefit overall skin balance effectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dermatologist can suggest many different procedures to have the situations under control. You must be aware of the natural balance and texture of your skin type in order to decide the necessary amount of treatments and additional aids to follow.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>IMPROVING YOUR SKIN BALANCE WITH NATURAL REMEDIES</strong> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from picking special </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facial treatments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beauty parlor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can also ensure the control measures to be taken easily by adjusting our periodic activities in a day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all begins right from your hands at home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you sick of all that unwanted body hair that you just can’t seem to get rid off? Looking for a more permanent solution? We’re almost knee deep in summer and it’s your time to let out those silky smooth legs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although waxing can get a bit painful, with the right kind of treatment any pain can get tolerable!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can offer you the best </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair treatment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions at the most affordable prices!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hair removal is a necessity and needs to be a part of your daily beauty routine. Undoubtedly, the most preferred technique of hair removal is waxing. One of the most common misconceptions about waxing can be the thicker, denser hair growth after you wax. But on the contrary, waxing actually reduces hair growth; not to mention the soothing smooth skin you’re left with after. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-277 size-full" src="http://rupinis.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/waxing-singapore-.png" alt="waxing in singapore" width="960" height="724" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://appointments.rupinis.com/"><strong>MAKE AN APPOINTMENT</strong></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracing back to when it all began, waxing dates back to the Egyptian era where the queens invested most of their time ineffective hair removal techniques. They would remove almost all of their body hair with whatever they could find such as beeswax, sugar or even seashells as tweezers! Here in Rupini’s Beauty Parlor, we have it all covered with the latest hair removal techniques carefully designed for your comfort.</span></p>
<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s Hot! But not too hot! Soothing hot wax is poured over the desired area and the hair is pulled in the opposite direction. Waxing removes hair from its roots and henceforth becomes very effective. Depending on your hair type, waxing prevents hair growth for an average of two to even six weeks! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial hair although tricky can be useful in some cases such as your eyebrows. If you’re worried about prolonging those bushy brows or slightly tweaking those brows to perfectly complement your face structure, don&#8217;t you worry as we have got you covered with many exclusive packages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Rupini’s, we pride ourselves in providing the best beauty treatments. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial hair bleach</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyebrow Shaping</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyebrow threading</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a lot more in the store! We provide these services from amongst the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best hair specialists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons for changing hair growth patterns can be due to a difference in medication, diseases such as PCOD or just simply hereditary! But don&#8217;t let that stop you from wearing your favorite summer dress.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at other ways to get rid of body hair, imagine having to glide through your skin with a one-inch razor with a promise to retain hair growth only for a day or two? With waxing, although your hair looks thicker, it is not so. It only appears so as your new hair follicle has not been exposed to pollutants, chemicals or the sun. </span></p>
<h4><strong>Why wax and not shave?</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaving not only leaves you with rashes and irritable skin but can also lead to ingrown hairs. Ingrown hairs are those hairs that have crawled inside within your skin instead of rising from it. As a result, they look like small lumps on your skin which can often be mistaken for just temporary blisters or hives. As dead skin clogs up on the epidermis, it forces the hair to grow sideways instead of upwards. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaving can also be undesirable in several different ways from having to suffer from razor cuts to having to do it on a regular basis. Shaving is only a quick-fix to your body hair problems. So you know what you need to do before going on that quick brunch with your ladies.</span></p>
<h4><strong>IMPORTANCE OF WAXING</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are you more likely to get rid of your dead cells, but waxing also prevents the growth of ingrown hairs! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waxing doesn’t just make hair grow much sparse but also reduces its thickness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many waxing solutions contain moisturising elements that help soften the skin before removing hair. So it not gets rid of that unwanted hair but also leaves a smoother surface with no prickly stubble.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With waxing, you are minimising your risks of itchy skin, and with the right kind of assistance at our service, we can look for the solution that suits you best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides hair removal, we also provide a variety of other services best for rejuvenating your hair and skin such as hair and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facial spa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hair treatment and stylish and of course a fully functioning </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
