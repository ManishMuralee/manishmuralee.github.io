				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Affordable salon in Singapore &#8211; rupini&#8217;s &#8211; dicussing about <span style="color: #ff6600;">skin care</span>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skyrocketing pollution and stress levels, associated with the lifestyle tend to take a toll on your body and skin by prematurely ageing the faces of city dwellers, accelerating wrinkles and age spots. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are tons of topical creams in the market, nothing can rejuvenate your skin like a professional massage and well-advised skin therapies. So, ever wanted to see how beautiful you really are? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take years off your face and body? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best spa in Singapore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sharing some incredible tips to have that celebrity like face and skin.</span></p>
<h4><strong>The idea of skin rejuvenation sounds really appealing, isn’t it? But <span style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">which one do you choose ?</span></span> </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to skincare there is no “one golden rule”. And no single modality that can do everything. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your skin shows what’s happening internally and you have to pay attention to what you eat and how you live. No skin care technique is complete without making some lifestyle changes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a person’s face look young or old involves a number of variables like skin tone, texture, sagging, wrinkles, and loss of volume. The last three variables happen due to the lack of collagen production, which is considered as the structural support of your skin. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the beautification and rejuvenation techniques that involve going under the knife, now we have more natural, non-surgical and less invasive techniques that are taking a huge stride. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the popular treatments that are trending in skin rejuvenation</span></p>
<h4><b>Natural facelift facials</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Cleopatra to Kardashian, facials have been a secret of glowing skin for centuries now. Facials are known to be an ultimate life saver as it promises to turn back the clock by lifting jawline, eradicating lines and wrinkles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-323 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies.png" alt="facial in singapore" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/facial-tampanies-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a complete natural technique that specialises in keeping the structure of the face and neck synchronised, which involves bones, lymph, muscles, skin, connective tissue. It involves manual lymph drainage, promoting oxygenation and circulation which helps facial muscles and tissues.</span></p>
<h4><b>Body scrub and body polish</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who thought the scrubs are specifically for the face, we have a news for you. A body scrub is a popular treatment that exfoliates and hydrates your skin, leaving your skin smooth and soft.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-322 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore.png" alt="best parlour in Singapore" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/popular-beauty-parlour-in-singapore-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is done using abrasive material like salt and sugar along with essential oils. A high-quality moisturizer is applied leaving the skin baby like.</span></p>
<h4><b>Body and face Massage</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to dermatologists, massaging the face and body at least once a month can do wonders for your skin. It helps the skin to get rid of the dirt, excess oil, and dead skin that accumulate on your skin giving a clean attractive and radiant appearance increasing circulation, skin tightening after weight loss or pregnancy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-327 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore.png" alt="massage in singapore" width="1000" height="750" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-300x225.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-768x576.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-830x623.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-230x173.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-350x263.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/body-and-face-massage-in-singapore-480x360.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not just the skin, it also has some amazing health benefits like reducing puffiness, sinus pressure and fluid retention.</span></p>
<h4><b>Chemical peeling</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a technique where a chemical solution is used to remove damaged skin, which causes the outer layer of the skin to exfoliate and eventually to peel off. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-328" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore.png" alt="chemical peel at home" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/chemical-peeling-in-singapore-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps to rejuvenate the skin and reveal the healthier looking skin underneath which often is smoother, less wrinkled and damaged.</span></p>
<h4><b>Microdermabrasion</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the non chemical and non invasive procedure that involves a special applicator with an abrasive surface, to sand away the thick outer layer of the skin and helps in skin rejuvenation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-325 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore.png" alt="skin care treatment in singapore" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/skin-treatment-in-singapore-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Isn’t beauty all about being comfortable in your own skin? Are you satisfied with the products you use? Being one of the best <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty salon</a> experts, here’s what we have got to share.</p>
<h1 style="display: none;"><b>&lt;&gt;Best Salon In Singapore</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the increased use of social media, people tend to hear a lot of opinions on how one is supposed to maintain your physical appearance. Nevertheless, taking care of your body is an important task and one to be taken very seriously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beauty products play a major role in your day to day lives, be it for minor users to heavy users. Even for those who rarely look to products for their look, beauty products do in fact matter. And for this sole reason, choosing the right beauty products is key. But this is easier said than done.</p>
<h3>To help you choose the right products, here are some tips:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the various available beauty products in the market right now, choosing the right one seems to be a tedious task. You need to make sure that the product you buy brings out the best in you. A wasted investment is a no can do. Here are a few tips to help you choose your product:</p>
<p><b>1. GO FOR THE QUALITY BRANDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Money is something that needs to be spent carefully, but when it comes to self-care, don&#8217;t settle for less. Quality comes with a cost. Big brands come with a heavy price tag, but they guarantee results. Besides, products of poor quality pose threats to your body. So, the next time you hit the market make sure you buy one that you trust.</p>
<p><b>2. KNOW WHAT YOU NEED</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned earlier, your product needs to favor your body. So, before you buy, make sure that you’ve done your homework on what you need. Do not fall prey to cheap marketing schemes. Rather, do your research and make sure you are buying the right product for yourself.</p>
<p><b>3. ONLINE SHOPPING CAN WAIT</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People tend to buy things online due to the ease of access. But when it comes to beauty products, online shopping is not the best option. Online shopping sites are not 100% reliable. And even if they are, unless you have used the product before or at least have a clear idea about what product you are going to buy, shopping online can take the back seat. Heading out to your nearest shop and physically buying it gives you an idea on what you actually need.</p>
<p><b>4. LOOK FOR AN EXPERT OPINION</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your friends may have the best advice on everything else but when it comes to the right product, make sure you look for an expert opinion. Now, it doesn&#8217;t mean that this opinion needs to come from the best beauticians across the globe, it could just be an opinion from someone who knows exactly what each product does. This means it could be from the woman working in a nearby beauty parlour or <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty salon</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-302" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-300x200.png" alt="Best Salon In Singapore " width="769" height="512" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102-480x320.png 480w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock-338483102.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p>The idea is to make sure that you buy something that you are comfortable with. So, this may differ from person to person.<br />
Regardless, taking care of your skin is essential. Beauty products only act as a bonus. So, make sure you make sporadic visits to salons.<br />
Choosing the right <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">salon</a> or parlour is just as important. Your visits need to be worth your time. Luckily we have that covered for you.</p>

<h3><strong>FACTORS THAT AFFECT YOUR SKIN</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several factors that diminish your chance of maintaining a smooth skin texture. You must be aware of the common reasons that cause the need to care for your skin before learning about the solutions in hand.</span></p>
<p><strong>DRYNESS OF SKIN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire area of concern revolves around the dryness of your skin that causes rough and cracked texture. Dry skin is characterized by tight and moderately rough skin consistency. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of the body commonly subjected to dryness or cracking must be usually hands, feet, and lips. The overall effect of this imbalance could cause a rooted malady in the long run.</span></p>
<p><strong>PRONENESS TO ACNE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frequent occurrence of acne will affect the smoothness of your skin texture by restricting the flawless and seamless nature of balance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving natural treatment plans for acne control will benefit overall skin balance effectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dermatologist can suggest many different procedures to have the situations under control. You must be aware of the natural balance and texture of your skin type in order to decide the necessary amount of treatments and additional aids to follow.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>IMPROVING YOUR SKIN BALANCE WITH NATURAL REMEDIES</strong> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from picking special </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/facial-treatment-singapore"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facial treatments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">beauty parlor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can also ensure the control measures to be taken easily by adjusting our periodic activities in a day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all begins right from your hands at home.</span></p>
<p><strong>DAILY CLEANSING</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can maintain the daily bloom of your face by ensuring proper cleansing habits and techniques on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your face twice in a day with appropriate cleansers and rinse it off with lukewarm water. Always take precautionary measures regarding oil control over the skin.</span></p>
<p><strong>NUTRITION AND HEALTH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glowing and vibrant skin reflects the energy of your health. Remaining healthy in terms of nutrition and diet would be of prime influence that affects your skin naturally.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diet you follow affects your health and aging of the body. You can enhance your daily nourishment by adding rich varieties of foods like avocado, walnuts, and broccoli.</span></p>
<p><strong>DAILY EXERCISE AND PHYSIQUE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the physical developments and benefits offered by following regular physical exercises, studies have shown that it has a direct effect on your skin’s health. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case of dermatological conditions like proneness to acne due to extreme sweating or conditions arising from exposure to sunlight, appropriate and necessary treatments are to be followed to keep your skin protected while working out.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you sick of all that unwanted body hair that you just can’t seem to get rid off? Looking for a more permanent solution? We’re almost knee deep in summer and it’s your time to let out those silky smooth legs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although waxing can get a bit painful, with the right kind of treatment any pain can get tolerable!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can offer you the best </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/hair-loss-treatment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair treatment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions at the most affordable prices!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hair removal is a necessity and needs to be a part of your daily beauty routine. Undoubtedly, the most preferred technique of hair removal is waxing. One of the most common misconceptions about waxing can be the thicker, denser hair growth after you wax. But on the contrary, waxing actually reduces hair growth; not to mention the soothing smooth skin you’re left with after. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/waxing-singapore"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-277 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore-.png" alt="waxing in singapore" width="960" height="724" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore-.png 960w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--300x226.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--768x579.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--830x626.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--230x173.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--350x264.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/waxing-singapore--480x362.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/appointment"><strong>MAKE AN APPOINTMENT</strong></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracing back to when it all began, waxing dates back to the Egyptian era where the queens invested most of their time ineffective hair removal techniques. They would remove almost all of their body hair with whatever they could find such as beeswax, sugar or even seashells as tweezers! Here in Rupini’s Beauty Parlor, we have it all covered with the latest hair removal techniques carefully designed for your comfort.</span></p>
<h4><strong>How does it work?</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s Hot! But not too hot! Soothing hot wax is poured over the desired area and the hair is pulled in the opposite direction. Waxing removes hair from its roots and henceforth becomes very effective. Depending on your hair type, waxing prevents hair growth for an average of two to even six weeks! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial hair although tricky can be useful in some cases such as your eyebrows. If you’re worried about prolonging those bushy brows or slightly tweaking those brows to perfectly complement your face structure, don&#8217;t you worry as we have got you covered with many exclusive packages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Rupini’s, we pride ourselves in providing the best beauty treatments. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/skin-bleaching"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facial hair bleach</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/eyebrow-threading-singapore"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyebrow Shaping</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/eyebrow-threading-singapore"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eyebrow threading</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a lot more in the store! We provide these services from amongst the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best hair specialists</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons for changing hair growth patterns can be due to a difference in medication, diseases such as PCOD or just simply hereditary! But don&#8217;t let that stop you from wearing your favorite summer dress.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at other ways to get rid of body hair, imagine having to glide through your skin with a one-inch razor with a promise to retain hair growth only for a day or two? With waxing, although your hair looks thicker, it is not so. It only appears so as your new hair follicle has not been exposed to pollutants, chemicals or the sun. </span></p>
<h4><strong>Why wax and not shave?</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaving not only leaves you with rashes and irritable skin but can also lead to ingrown hairs. Ingrown hairs are those hairs that have crawled inside within your skin instead of rising from it. As a result, they look like small lumps on your skin which can often be mistaken for just temporary blisters or hives. As dead skin clogs up on the epidermis, it forces the hair to grow sideways instead of upwards. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaving can also be undesirable in several different ways from having to suffer from razor cuts to having to do it on a regular basis. Shaving is only a quick-fix to your body hair problems. So you know what you need to do before going on that quick brunch with your ladies.</span></p>
<h4><strong>IMPORTANCE OF WAXING</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are you more likely to get rid of your dead cells, but waxing also prevents the growth of ingrown hairs! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waxing doesn’t just make hair grow much sparse but also reduces its thickness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many waxing solutions contain moisturising elements that help soften the skin before removing hair. So it not gets rid of that unwanted hair but also leaves a smoother surface with no prickly stubble.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With waxing, you are minimising your risks of itchy skin, and with the right kind of assistance at our service, we can look for the solution that suits you best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides hair removal, we also provide a variety of other services best for rejuvenating your hair and skin such as hair and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facial spa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hair treatment and stylish and of course a fully functioning </span><a href="http://www.rupinis.com/hair-loss-treatment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Losing hair by the handful? It’s time to panic! While losing 100 to 150 strands of hair a day is considered somewhat normal, there’s no question that you still get a mini heart attack when you see a bunch crawling across your tiled floor. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that you need help from a hair care professional or to run to a <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">hair studio</a>.</p>
<h5>Did you know, the hair cells are the fastest growing cells in your body?</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are also the first ones to be affected if you don&#8217;t eat right or suffer from deficiencies because they are not required for survival. Now let’s find the culprits to your hair problems, shall we?</p>
<h1 style="display: none;"><b>&lt;&gt;hair studio</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike the labels on the back of our food items, the labels on the back of our hair products like shampoos are often left unread. In the last few years, there has been a lot of buzz going on regarding the presence of sulfate in shampoos. What are sulfates? They&#8217;re the reason your shampoo lather the way it does. They clean your scalp and hair, getting rid of all the dirt from it. While doing so, they may end up stripping your hair off of essential oils.</p>
<p>Ever wondered why your eye stings when shampoo runs down the side of your face? Well, Sulphates!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A little tip: If you feel any kind of irritation on the scalp or find your hair drying up over time then try and buy a shampoo that&#8217;s sulfate-free.</p>
<h5>Let’s not forget hair colouring!</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-213 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1.png" alt="hair-studio" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-657723538-1-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How many of us can resist that gorgeous shade of brown, especially under the winter sun? What if we told you that there’s a way to get that rich color and lustrous shine, that’s also, wait for it&#8230;Natural! Isn’t that what every girl is craving now? Luscious hair naturally.</p>

<h5>Deep conditioning</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To condition or not to condition, a question every girl asks if she is thinking about stepping out, even if it’s for just a few hours. A deep conditioning session never hurts anybody even if you condition your hair after every wash. Nothing works quite as good as deep conditioning. Squeeze out the extra water after washing your hair with shampoo, and towel dry it. Then take a dollop of conditioner and apply it right to the root of your hair. Use a wide toothed comb to run through your hair so that the conditioner reaches everywhere. Leave in the conditioner for anywhere between 10 minutes to an hour. Rinse thoroughly to enjoy silky smooth hair.</p>
<h5>Oil conditioning</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oil is the answer, when it comes to your hair you&#8217;ll find all kinds of advice. Mothers&#8217; will tell you to &#8220;oil your hair&#8221; while your hairdresser will recommend the new IT thing &#8220;hair spa, Moroccan oil, strengthening not rebonding and all.&#8221; A conditioner might work wonders for your hair but oil gives it certain minerals, vitamins and essential fatty acids that don&#8217;t just strengthen your roots but also boost the overall health of your hair. A <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">good hair salon in Singapore</a>, like Rupini’s, will have their very own blend of oil for devout customers. Blended especially for Rupini&#8217;s customers by using traditional methods and only natural products, the Shirupini oil and hair mask comes most recommended by hair experts. It can protect your hair from sun damage, dandruff and remove sebum build-up from hair follicles accelerating hair growth.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Tremendously successful in preventing the first signs of hair fall and renewing hair growth, our Shirupini hair mask promotes scalp rejuvenation. Complete with a customized massage regime (scalp, neck, arms, and hands), Mahashirupini package provides total relaxation, enhancing harmony and inner peace.</p>
<h5>Heat control treatment</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep away the heat, Vigorous styling in a <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">hair studio</a> and hair treatments including <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">hair loss</a> treatment over the years can cause your hair to fall out. Whether you do the styling yourself or with the help of a <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">hair stylist</a> Singapore, the risks of overstyling is still there. Examples of extreme styling include tight braids, hair weaves or cornrows as well as chemical relaxers to straighten your hair, hot-oil treatments or any kind of harsh chemical or high heat. Since these practices can adversely affect the hair root, your hair might not grow back. Letting your hair air dry and limiting the amount of time the curling iron/ heat-driven products come in contact with your hair to no more than once a week, are simple ways that can make a world of difference in your overall appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay happy, as emotional stress can also disrupt the normal cycle of hair growth and cause temporary hair loss. Most people witness a general thinning of hair several months after a physical or emotional shock. Fret not, once the stress is brought under control, normal hair growth is usually restored.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Say so long to millennial pink. There’s another pink-tinted hue in town set to take over 2019</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The decision makers of what will be the next year’s ‘Color of the Year’ is the Pantone Color Institute, Pantone’s consulting division that analyzes each year’s color trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pantone has announced that Living Coral, a bright coral shade, is its 2019 Color of the Year. Although it may seem more pink in nature, Pantone is describing Living Coral as “an animated, life-affirming shade of orange, with golden undertones.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pantone also quoted Living Coral as a color of carefree happiness, a feeling that, perhaps, people might be craving in today’s landscape.</p>
<h5>So how can we embody this living coral into our life?</h5>
<h1 style="display: none;"><b>&lt;&gt;makeup artist </b></h1>
<h5><b>Fashion</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there’s one obvious thing about this year’s fashion trends is that we’re going to see a lot of coral hues around us, and we mean not just in the summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living coral is not a shade that’s limited to summer. Its warm undertone makes it perfect for any season because let’s face it, we all need a bit of vividness in our life, no matter the season. Unless you’d rather be dull or moody.</p>
<h5><b>Makeup</b></h5>
<p>No one can take away the love for <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">makeup</a> from us girls or women.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-201 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414.png" alt="makeup-artist" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1297675414-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We tell you, Living Coral is a shade practically made for makeup. And there are so many ways to wear this gorgeous hue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pantone Color of the Year is surely one of the most anticipated annual announcements in the <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty world</a>. As soon as the shade was revealed, it&#8217;s immediately scrutinized for wearability and versatility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of these shades, over the years, have been instantly acclaimed, like 2015&#8217;s deep burgundy shade, Marsala, which obviously belonged on lips and nails. Others, like 2017&#8217;s pea-like Greenery, imposed a difficult challenge for those who stick to more classic makeup colors. But Living Coral is sure to please the broadest <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty base</a> yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we say Living Coral is a wear-anywhere kind of color, we mean that in two ways. You can easily wear the not-quite-orange, not-quite-pink shade anywhere you go; you can also wear it anywhere on your face without having to step outside your comfort zone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peachy hues like Living Coral, is a shade that neutralizes your skin&#8217;s own undertones, which are usually some combination of yellow and pink, and warms up your complexion, even adapting to your skin tone.</p>
<h5><b>Lipstick</b></h5>
<p>Everyone looks incredibly gorgeous in a matte coral lip. Depending on your skin tone you can choose the right shade of coral that suits you from the huge array of products already available in the market. As always look for something that provides a super long-lasting colour pay off, yet is incredibly soft and comfortable on the lips.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-203 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783.png" alt="makeup-artist" width="1000" height="673" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-300x202.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-768x517.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-830x559.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-230x155.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-350x236.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1250710783-480x323.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h5><b>Blush</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Liquid or powder, a bright, sunny coral always lifts our spirits all seasons. Blush is one of the most crucial makeup items for a gorgeous healthy glow. If you need any convincing that this vibrant shade looks amazing on you, sweep some onto the apples of your cheeks, jawline or even nose to look captivating in coral makeup.</p>
<h5><b>Lip Balm</b></h5>
<p><b>Is wearing lipstick all day too much for you?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Give your lips a hint of glossy color with the super-comfortable feel of a moisturizing balm. Put on a sheer veil of a coral lip balm for an ‘I woke up like this’ <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty look</a>.</p>
<h5><b>Eye Shadow</b></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coral is surprisingly easy to be worn on the eyelids. Coral eyeshadow shades are feminine, romantic and uber chic. They are also great for every day and perfect for beginners. Whatever the finish is, matte, metallic, satin, or glitter, worn individually or in tandem, this poppy vibrant hue creates an irresistibly tawny look. Bonus: They can be layered on for more drama too.</p>
<h5><b>Nail Polish</b></h5>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-200 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203.png" alt="makeup-artist" width="1000" height="641" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-300x192.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-768x492.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-830x532.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-230x147.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-350x224.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock-1252547203-480x308.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Can you imagine how gorgeous Living Coral looks on your fingertips?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coral has long been one of the most popular <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">nail</a> colors because it&#8217;s flattering and easy to wear, but it also lends itself to bolder looks. While there are lots of Living Coral-inspired products bound to launch in 2019, there are also plenty of already-available items that can help you incorporate the Color of the Year into your beauty look.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pantone’s Color of the Year is taking the <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">beauty</a> world by storm, inspiring fresh new trends and inspiring you to be your most stunning self inside and out. Even if worn for a monochromatic look, this colour won’t overwhelm your features. If Living Coral is any sign, it’s safe to say 2019 will be a year of beauty, good times, and new experiences.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The exploration for the mountain of youth has been going on for the centennial. After all, as we grow and become elder and elder, our skin normally begins to sag and lose its youthful elasticity like young blood. However, going under the painful and overlong treatment with a knife is not the only way to make your skin looking supple and young.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have headed over to a new year hoping for the best of everything. And we have many dreams to get cherished and awaiting the coming days. Last year we have seen many different trends that are unique and creative in varied manners.</p>
<h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you fancy to be a limited edition? Get a signature look that creates a unique transient look.</p>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before coming to the new year trends, Let us analyse the trends of 2018</p>
<h4>The year of glitter</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bold and pretty vogues had a come back in the past year. The focus has been shifted from a stunning attire to a cute face. The year showed a fast pace of changing fashion trends along with the beauty vogue.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-166 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019.png" alt="beauty parlour" width="1000" height="562" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-300x169.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-768x432.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-830x466.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-230x129.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-350x197.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trends-of-2019-480x270.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h5>
<li>Natural beauty products</li>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The trends extend to an elevating organic beauty boom making everyone aware of the health of their ever-loving skin and wellness. Go chemical free was one of the slogans of beauty trends of 2018. By the end of the year, the market showed an increasing trend in the demand for organic personal care products.</p>
<h5>
<li>Exfoliation and nourishment with peel</li>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than going for a 60 minutes <a href="http://rupinis.com">facial</a> which gives a perfect glow for the coming days, more girls where opting a peel which could clean, exfoliate and nourish their skin. Accompanying a facial massage can have a great deal with the same.</p>
<h5>
<li>Holistic treatments</li>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imbue your mein with whole body treatment rather than focusing on your face. Everyone started treating their body as they would do their face. Our varying weather always calls for sufficient treatments to get rid of issues related to the changing climate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic.png" alt="beauty parlour" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/holistic-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h5>
<li>Bespoke personalised products</li>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A personalised approach is made to everyone concerning every minute details. In the case of skin care, it tackles almost every issue and blends the benefits of all supremes packs of beauty elements.</p>
<h4>Brand new trends for 2019</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite your evergreen personal style, it will be more fine and splendid if you get used to ideas before they become too usual. Make sure that you are steering in the right direction with the new fashion.</p>
<h5>1. <a href="http://rupinis.com">Eyebrow Threading</a> and microblading</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eyebrows have been the main element in beauty treatments. A well defined eyebrows are always demanded more than ever. An emerging trend with the eyebrow is microblading in which a tattooing technique is used to add semi-permanent pigments in to the skin.</p>
<h5>2. Eyelash Extensions</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like you get extensions for your hair, it has become popular to use eyelash extensions. Eyelash extensions are single lashes, made of synthetic materials such as silk, mink, or something different to these textures, that should be attached to your existing lovely lashes semi-permanently to make it look more better.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-174 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash.png" alt="beauty parlour" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/eyelash-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h5>3. Fashion Colors</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great advancements in hair color formulas are being made by the past couple of years by <a href="http://rupinis.com">hair stylists</a>, many inventions are also being conceived to make it more better than before and a little creative stuff enclosing arts in the same. This new path of fashion colors doesn’t makes any limit in your choices to try out different shades.</p>
<h5>4. Vegan Cosmetics</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new trend in product is making it vegan which does not contain any animal elements or animal-derived elements. Some essential ingredients are included, which cannot be limited from beauty products because of their properties like, honey, bee wax, albumen, carmine, gelatin, and many others.</p>
<h5>5. Nail Art</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from pedicure and manicure from <a href="http://rupinis.com">nail salon</a> which makes your nails healthy and clean, nail art has been a part of beauty trends. And now nail polishes which changes colour even according to the mood of the user are also available.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-176 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art.png" alt="beauty parlour" width="1000" height="664" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-300x199.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-768x510.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-830x551.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-350x232.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/nail-art-480x319.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h5>6. Charcoal Masks</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best and effective beauty element is activated charcoal, which is perhaps one of the biggest beauty crazes right now, and with fine reason to make use of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why slather your face with chemical products when you can use simple Ayurvedic herbs for facial?</strong></p>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike other beauty therapies, an Ayurvedic facial therapy is known to be the <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">best facial treatment</a> for any skin type. It is a divinely relaxing experience that purifies, hydrates, nourishes, and rejuvenates skin for a luminous glow. This natural treatment uses dosha balancing organic essential oil blends with aromatherapy benefits to heighten the sensorial experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the expensive salon treatments, synthetic skin products, and makeup stuffed with harmful chemicals, we are simply torturing our skin. Harsh skin care products surely take a toll on the skin’s health and to rejuvenate and restore the same, Ayurveda comes with <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">affordable facial</a> treatments that are amazingly effective and harmless.</p>
<h4>Tired of dry sensitive skin?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give your skin the ample hydration that it so deserves, herbal packs are used which is especially beneficial for those suffering from dry skin problems. This herbal mix of moisturizing agents provides an instant boost of hydration and ensure your skin stays hydrated for a good amount of time.</p>

<h4>Craving for timeless beauty?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rupini&#8217;s Chakra Gold facial has anti-aging benefits. Chakra Gold facial begins with a gentle massage routine to bring your awareness to the Solar Plexus, Manipura Chakra. Additionally, this therapy involves lymphatic drainage and is excellent for blood circulation. Finally, a mineral-rich Gold mask is applied to improve skin elasticity, control pigmentation and excessive melanin formation leaving you with instant rejuvenation.</p>
<h4>Suffering from blemishes and acne scarring?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ayurvedic massage therapy or a <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">facial spa</a> therapy can be beneficial in taking care of acne and the acne scars that have been left on your skin for far too long. If you have blemishes that leave a dark patch on your skin, an Ayurvedic massage with oils and packs that suit your skin type will aid in tackling this problem.</p>

<h4>Missing out on that radiant healthy glow?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In today’s world, pollution is an everyday problem that can result in dull skin and enhanced skin texture. However, your dream of owning a radiant and flawless skin can finally come true with a little bit of help from Nature. The herbal and natural ingredients ensure that your skin is well-nourished and radiant.</p>
<h4>Have you been taking good care of your eyes?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s face it, we can’t avoid sleep shortages or work-related travels or having to spend hours in front of a computer any longer. But what we can do is spend a little time to give the eyes some focused attention and pampering. Experts know best! Instead of DIY-ing, consider getting an expert eye therapy session for those tired, overworked eyes. Rupini’s Eyes Awake is a refreshing eye therapy created to re-hydrate the delicate eye area and soothe stress using exfoliating enzymes and some of our secret signature blend of products.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apart from Ayurvedic treatment sessions, what can you do to keep your skin healthy?</strong></p>
</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-132 size-full" src="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow.png" alt="best facial treatment singapore" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow.png 1000w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-300x200.png 300w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-768x512.png 768w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-830x554.png 830w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-230x153.png 230w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-350x233.png 350w, http://www.rupinis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/glow-480x320.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h4>Beauty Sleep is a Thing</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best Ayurvedic beauty tips for glowing skin is taking a sound and restful sleep of approximately 7-8 hours a day. During the span of 8 hours of sleep, the skin cells repair, replenish, and rejuvenate to bestow a healthy-looking skin. Ayurveda suggests incorporating ‘beauty sleep’ regime as an indispensable part to give the skin a proper boost.</p>
<h4>Reduce Stress to Rejuvenate Skin</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Lifestyle stress’ means ‘skin stress’. Stress makes the skin dark, dull and leads to early signs of aging. Stress reduction is required to get a radiant and healthy looking skin and can be achieved by doing meditation, pranayama, and yoga.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by nature’s essence, Ayurveda is not about using certain herbs to treat issues. It is a way of life that can turn your lifestyle into becoming the best version of yourself.</p>
<h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Are you ready for your Ayurvedic makeover for clear and glowing skin?</strong></p>
</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from enhancing your self-confidence it also indicates a healthy self. Markets are flooded with products claiming to cure any skin problems known to man but prove to be a nightmare in the long run. Our dependence on these commercial skin products has increased due to our busy schedules, which creates even more skin issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead depend on Ayurvedic, which practices the age-old way of using kitchen ingredients and herbs to cure skin ailments. Rupini’s provide the best of Ayurvedic <a href="http://www.rupinis.com/">facial treatment in Singapore</a>.<br />
