<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you on the run looking for a pavement job for your housing project or building projects for your company? Are you on the stand making enquiries to choose between the pavement options that goes along with your quality plans? Then we must be able to frame your choice on a quick note. Let’s help you with some guidance to keep you updated on the search!</span></p>
<h3>What is your idea of pulling out a characteristic pavement job?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate objective of any pavement job is to finally provide a smooth and flawless surface regardless of the varieties and attractions it exhibits in the texture and designs. The distinctive feature of all building jobs have got to do with its stable outlook and durability. Recent developments among the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver productions</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that differ in endurance and quality related elements has introduced diverse processing stages that these pavements are subjected to withstand and contain themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the characteristic features of a good pavement work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flawless blending with an existing job. The scenario must be either expansion of pavements or to establish an entirely new job at the location. In both the cases, the overall outcome must integrate immaculate finish.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levelling. This has to do with the expertise required at the stage of laying the pave. An even surface would be expected with the utmost accuracy. The efficiency of the pave considerably depends on the convenience offered on opting different paving process.<br />
<a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water drain levelling at the gauge point. Standing water on any surface would always put your job out for maintenance due to damage, until and unless the pre-determined measures have been taken over the job to aid water withstanding features.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details are up to the mark. standing edges and points always come into attention after the completion of a pavement job. The accuracy and perfection of these areas determines the quality in details of the work.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>YOUR CHOICE DETERMINES YOUR PRODUCTION STANDARDS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice could be categorised in terms of processing stages as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet caste pavement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry caste pavement</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your selection of these production and processing techniques are based on the job you intend to build on. Both the approaches are favourable as per the job requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are expecting to carry out a seamless finish to your structures or building areas, then you would prefer using wet caste pavement techniques as it is characterised as a flowing mixture on the pre-settling period. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you opt to converge the result of your building structures or jobs towards tenacity and non-porous finish, your choice could ascend towards Dry caste method.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-420 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg" alt="paver mould making machine" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h3>DRY CASTE PAVEMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This production technique usually refers to the process that involves very less water content in ratio. The output pave is generally characterised by hard, rigid and extremely solid in structure. These comes into preference when expense and budget concerns are raised. They usually represent cheaper processing cost considering normal grade components used along the mixture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process technique comes with an advantage of settling relatively faster than other common techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is usually preferred when the job comprises works like manufacturing concrete blocks and concrete pipes and rings.</span></p>
<h3>WET CASTE PAVEMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This could be the most popular and preferred process that includes the essential mixtures in appropriate proportions that also takes into account the imperative water content ratio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further stages of production includes the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vibrating table</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment to pop out and eliminate the unwanted air bubbles that eventually expands within the settling concrete mix. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final stage of the process technique is carried out by providing significant time for the settling stage after undergoing several curing courses on the go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a highly adopted approach when durability and strength has been added to the requirement board. Nearly all the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>paver block machines</strong> </span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are fed with proportional water content to follow the wet caste procedures.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/chemicals-oxides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-419 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg" alt="color oxide in algeria" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longevity in home design is a precious gift, and your </span></i><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>concrete paving</i></a></span></strong><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blocks are the one thing you hope will perform well. </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it’s a much stronger and ostensibly durable material than asphalt, concrete will still crack and wear out over time. Once the instant fresh laid hot </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">paving block</span></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> starts the cooling process, it starts to age and becomes vulnerable to the wear and tear of use and environmental factors. You can, however, significantly delay such effects with proper maintenance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driveway paving blocks, along with other paved surfaces need good maintenance and care in order to have it last as long as possible. </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the moment it cools, the pavers start to break down from exposure to oil, gas, heat and cold extremes, sun oxidation, salt corrosion, water penetration, pressure and impact damage, and other factors.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your</span></i><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><i> concrete pavers</i></span></strong></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are properly installed and maintained, it should last for decades. </span></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain environmental intrusions, such as aggressive growth of tree roots or earth shifting, can cause cracks, but otherwise, your patio floor will remain intact for years and years.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Paver blocks</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> typically survive longer than regular concrete because it has more protective coatings. They usually include a color hardener and a sealant applied to the surface, which protects it better from wear and abrasion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tips are designed to be a handy reference to help you with preventative maintenance on your paved surfaces, whether they are residential or commercial. Many factors contribute to the proper maintenance of a </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">concrete </span></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">patio. This guide discusses some useful tactics for preserving yours.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The less direct interaction your paving blocks have with the elements, the longer it will last. So you can extend the life of </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">paver blocks</span></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a few extra years with a canvas patio cover or pergola. You might desire this addition for looks and comfort anyways, so the protective aspect makes it more worth the investment.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to carefully inspect your pavement on a regular basis and watch for any major cracks, fading of painted markings, signs that point to wear and tear and the signs that repair work may be needed soon.
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2"><img class="alignright wp-image-412 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg" alt="plastic mould for paver tiles" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /> </a></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your pavement clean; ideally, you should take a pressure washer or standard garden hose with a spray attachment and wash away dirt, debris, or other foreign contaminants every week or two. You can also use liquid dish soap and a broom to scrub away spills or bird poop, then rinse with a garden hose. If the concretegets stained by grease, food spills, or something else, try to clean up the spill as soon as possible.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seal coating definitely helps in slowing pavement deterioration and is useful on driveways, parking lots, and other surfaces. The sealer will also preserve the shine and color of the blocks. For maximum benefit, the standard recommendation for reapplication of sealer is once every two or three years, but if you notice the color fading or the sheen disappearing, you can have it reapplied sooner.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sealant on </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">concrete paver</span></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to resist strong elements and normal wear and tear. Certain heavy-duty chemicals can corrode it and eliminate the sheen prematurely, however. Products that contain ammonium nitrates and sulfates are particularly harmful because they’ll attack the concrete directly.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All car and foot traffic must be kept off surfaces that have just been sealed for a minimum of 24 hours to allow ample curing time- this is critical to ensuring the paving blocks are not weakened or damaged from the start.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper attention to the </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>tile </strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cracks and early patching of minor issues will prevent them from growing into major headaches and will be cheaper in the long run as well and will extend the life of your pavement.

</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tree and bush roots can compromise the integrity of your </span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">concrete </span></strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you don’t manage it properly. Roots will grow beneath the paving bricks, push it up, and cause it to crack. You can avoid a substantial cost of repairing with preventive measures. Have the roots in your yard trimmed regularly so they don’t endanger your pavers. You might also need to remove trees that develop extensive root systems to avoid future problems.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixing areas of ponding water as soon as possible reduces any chance of water seeping through and weakening the base and limits the formation of potholes and even worse the creation of sinkholes.</span></li>

Do you need to decide which mould, rubber or silicone mould is more suitable for your process?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We often have customers requesting silicone moulds. While we do not produce silicone moulds, our <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>paving moulds</strong></span></a> produce an equivalent quality of cast concrete products while keeping cost well below the cost of comparable silicone moulds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage to JR Rubbers’ proprietary blend of materials is that you get a commercial grade mould designed to be used hundreds if not thousands of times.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-499 size-large" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jr-01-06-1024x563.png" alt="pavers mould manufacturer india" width="660" height="363" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jr-01-06-1024x563.png 1024w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jr-01-06-300x165.png 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jr-01-06-768x422.png 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jr-01-06.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our moulds are very robust in design and do not require the use of a release agent while most mould manufacturers recommend using a release agent. The lack of need for release agents also provides additional cost savings from both a material standpoint as well as a reduction in labor cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #339966;"><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rubber moulds</strong></a></span> work very effectively and are the “go-to” option for casting concrete pavers. In some cases, a release agent is not required when casting concrete in these moulds, but it depends greatly on the components of the concrete mix.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using silicone rubbers may take away the need for release agents (which have the potential to affect the model); however, the oils from silicone rubbers also have the potential to affect the model in some way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Platinum silicone mould rubbers can be appealing because of their great release properties (tin-cured silicones should not be considered for concrete as they shrink over time and deteriorate with age), but overall, we find that the advantages of <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>rubber mould</strong></span></a> outweigh the advantages of silicone rubber for this <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>paving block</strong></span></a> manufacturing application.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to robustness and cost savings, our moulds provide excellent texture and general appearance as would be expected from an equivalent silicone mould. We stand behind our product 100%. You can be assured that our moulds meet or exceed the requirements of the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Efflorescence, which produces salt deposits on the surface of concrete, more often occurs when silicone rubber moulds are used for casting (in comparison to rubber moulds).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This white residue is aesthetically displeasing and to remove it, you may need to use solvents or other chemicals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with this, the overall color quality of the cast parts seem to differ depending on the mould material; concrete cast in rubber moulds tend to display more vivid color, where colors may appear muted when casting in silicone rubber moulds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/chemicals-oxides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-419 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg" alt="color oxide in algeria" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Silicone rubber moulds cost about twice as much as that of rubber <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>moulds</strong></span></a>. This is because, by weight, it would require more silicone rubber than polyurethane rubber to create the same <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>mould</strong></span></a> since silicone is denser.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cured polyurethane rubbers exhibit physical properties that are generally “tougher” than silicones, so they are more resilient to wear and tear when moulds are used repeatedly for years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here at JR Rubbers, we often recommend the use of rubber to make moulds for concrete casting (e.g., concrete tiles, panels, <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>pavers</strong></span></a>, bricks, countertops, edging, etc.).

<p style="text-align: justify;">Leveraging our refined manufacturing facility, we take up the challenge to design and develop a first-rate quality range of paver block making machines. Noted for their ideal performance and efficiency, these are highly used in construction industry. We offer different ranges in sizes and specifications to meet the motley requirements of clients. JR Rubber Industries uses Semi-Mechanised Paver Plant and Mini Paver Plant for paver block production. Now, let us take a deep look into it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-330" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-04.jpg" alt="automatic brick making" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-04.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-04-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-04-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-04-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SEMI-MECHANISED PAVER PLANT</strong>:</p>
<p>As compared to Mini paver plant, semi-mechanised paver plant possess more production capacity. This machine is well integrated with two pan mixers used for colouring, conveyor belt, four vibro forming tables, concrete mixer with hydraulic hopper and a distribution box. This vibro forming concrete tile making machine is designed in 8mm plate with 3000 drill holes. It is embedded with two 1.5 HP 3 phase motor with three <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines">Vibrofoming tables</a> and all other attentive extras.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/chemicals-oxides">color mixer</a> machine used for the <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/chemicals-oxides">color mixer in Turkey</a> have a production capacity of 150kg per each batch and high standard 3HP electric motor for power supply. With a production capacity of 500kg per batch with a hydraulic hooper the hydraulic muller type grey mixer machine sands ahead from others. With all other concerned necessary accessories, the conveyor nylon Conveyor belt has a size of 20ft and with a 3 HP motor. <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1">Rubber paver mould concrete casting in Cambodia</a> and many other countries are using this particular machinery features.</p>

<p><strong>MINI-PAVER PLANT</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1">Paving block machine manufacturers in India</a> and many other countries mainly use mini paver plants for paver production. It mainly includes a pan mixer for color mixing, a concrete mixer with hydraulic hopper, two vibro forming tables. It has 8mm plate with 3000 drill holes and a 3 phase motor attached with it. It also includes three vibro forming tables and other interested accomplices. With these machines, we can produce a large number of paving blocks in various colors, shapes, and patterns. The tile making machine is involved with the automatic movement of the rubber mould. The important parts of this machine are paver mixer machine for the color layer mix and a hydraulic muller type grey mixer with the hydraulic hopper. For efficient production advanced technical assistance is also provided along with these machines.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paver block installation can be a real problem if you don&#8217;t know where or when to start the construction of your pavement. There are things that you must do to make your paver blocks strong like </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interlocking paver mould</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can provide you with a strong foundation and stability for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com">paver block design</a>.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there are things that one must not do, the  “Don’ts” not to follow while installing a paver block, for example, one cannot use lightweight paver blocks for their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com">parking tiles</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as due to the constant heavy weight vehicles the lightweight pavers may break. One must use </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paver forms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">heavy and have good quality.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one follows the Do’s and Don&#8217;ts </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pavement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">installation, one can make sure to have a strong and durable paver design, that can serve one for a long time. If you hope to have a strong paver block design make sure to follow the list below:-     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)Don&#8217;t Cut the Corners<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark all the pipelines, telephone lines and all other resources available under your paver block creation, make sure that you find the proper source and area for your pavement. Rather cutting the corners right where your paver block ends, take a bit more space and make sure to widen the cut.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your pavement in 10&#215;20 do not cut the edges at 10 or 20, but add one inch more  and cut 11-21. By doing so you are provided with a better chance to have a well-finished paver block that can provide you with a better chance to have a large and ample paver pathway. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg" alt="rubber paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)Requirement of the base material<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot assume the amount of cement, quantity of paver blocks and other materials would come in need. So don&#8217;t do the calculation of the number of paver blocks you may need, as if you buy them before you might have to make frequent visits to the shop to buy more or either you will have many paver blocks still left with you after the paver block is constructed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A solution to this problem is buying pavers according to the work, for the start of the project have a minimum amount of paver blocks with you, when the project is half over or the minimum amount of the paver blocks get over, consult with your contractor and purchase the paver blocks needed.     </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)Use paver molds<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people avoid using paver molds under their paver blocks as they feel it is of no use and has a very less benefit. Not using paver molds can result in a less durable paver block design a very fragile design that can dispatch or break any moment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use paver molds you can easily avoid many problems in the future related to your paver blocks, in fact you can even provide yourself with a more durable and strong paver block design that can serve you for a long period of time. By using interlocking paver block molds you can also avoid problems like weed and grass growth on your paver block. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4)Take time<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can use their maximum time on the construction of the pavement, unlike any other flooring option pavement can be laid easily. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than all those points there are many more points to be considered while installing paver. Many are not aware of the work involved with the installation of </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block paving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These factors are not mentioned to scare anyone, but still, a little planning will go a long way. Unilock or </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interlocking paver blocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a brilliant technical assistance for the better installation of pavers. You can follow the do’s and don&#8217;ts mentioned below to avoid common mistakes.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0139.jpg" alt="paver mould india" width="774" height="1032" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0139.jpg 774w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0139-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0139-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /></p>
<p><b>PRE-INSTALLATION AND PLANNING</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do’s- Make a reasonable drawing of the area you intend to work with</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scale drawing is helpful than a computer-generated drawing. It is said so because pencil drawing will assist with the planning on the site and also it can help with the calculation of all the materials required. Find a space to incorporate a drainage plan in your plan because many think that water will percolate down through the paving stone joints but this is actually a great mistake. For the good tuning and selection of your product and design, a good plan will help with it. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t &#8211; Guess at the area you want to cover</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make the area bigger and bigger is the most heard complaint ever. These words are not a compliment to sell more products but many people have the problem in visualizing their job and they fail to realize that once their yard is set. Rather than an effort a small amount of materials and work is the thing only needed to make your project bigger. Lay your garden hose out to represent the perimeter of the project. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do &#8211; Plan the receiving of materials</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coordinating the delivery of new materials and removing the existing material is the next stage of planning. There will a number of materials you are dealing with and all of it can add with different materials that need to be kept separate. So you should keep a plan before things go as soon as they are delivered. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t- Overestimate the amount of work you can get done</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s better to do larger projects over a couple of weekends, one for removing existing materials and excavation and the other for </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paver making </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and base. Hiring a company is a better choice to save your time. Even though it costs, your works can be made easier and faster if it is done so. </span></p>
<p><b>BASE PREPARATION</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t- Cut corners</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to decide the design and size of the job you start with the excavation. Mark all gas lines, phones lines and also over-excavate the perimeter of the area. For example, if your enclosure is set for 20✕10 feet then you should extends your base preparation past the finished size.</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paver moulds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are made in such a way that the base material extend past the paved edge an equal distance of the base depth. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t- Guess at how much base material is required</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there are no absolute rules to determine depth a few comments on the depth of the base materials is being necessary. Driveways and walkways requires different amount of quantity for laying base. Basically, to facilitate drainage clay bases need to be dug deeper. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t-  Locale plastic under paving application </b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeds start from the top of the cracks and work their roots down in most cases. Usage of polymeric sand can prevent weeds to a great extent. Sometimes </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavement in Qatar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> place a granular base with geotextile base it will work as a mechanical barrier to stabilize and stop the clay from mixing with your good sub-base materials.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-05.jpg" alt="plastic moulds for interlocking tiles" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t-  Compact the bedding sand</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compacting the bending sand is the most common mistake. Loose sand given in between the pavers will allow them to set and also this kind of sand will allow the tamping process to even out the top surface of the pavers. </span></p>
<p><b>INSTALLING THE PAVERS</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do- Start laying the pavers on the longest straight wall</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poured in place curbs and foundation are rarely straight. There should be even a small gap seen after the completion of the project. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t- Hammer the pavers together</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t lay the pavers tightly, it may raise issues in the future. Don&#8217;t measure the gap just set them beside one another. Its better to space the stones out rather than hammering them to straighten the face.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do- Use edge restraint </b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of their use, all projects need to be restrained properly to avoid creeping around the perimeter of the area. As edge restraint are flexible they can be used to tune your design. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, there are lots of do’s and don&#8217;ts mentioned but while installing products in its correct way can provide a long-lasting tremendous job that you can be proud with. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricks are used as building material for pavements and construction of houses. In India, the </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brick mold </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">were used only for building to fit bricks to make houses in rural India, but now with the modern architecture bricks are also used to create pathways these days in India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is clay that helps in the </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brick making</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the old days, but now there are bricks made of concrete, metal and many other materials. Soon the material became a decorative item rather being used only for sidewalks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brick making in Uganda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an art practised for a long time. The use of bricks in Uganda can be easily found as it was a rural area once bricks like fire brick, half bricks and quarry tiles are most of the bricks uses in Uganda. There were times when bricks were cheap when bricks were the only type of </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wall tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we had in our house. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricks are used by most construction industry as it the most durable and affordable material, different types of bricks offer you with different types of benefits, used for different purpose and according to the job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Bricks- </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Burnt clay Bricks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Pressing molds helps to create common burnt clay bricks. Dried and then burned in a kiln. These are the most found common bricks, they are mostly used for building and are not the type of bricks that you would use for decoration.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sand-lime Bricks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></span></p>

Sand mixing with fly ash and lime with a chemical process helps you create a sand-lime bricks. Later the mix is shaped into a brick which is used for construction compared to clay bricks having a grey colour compared to the usual red, no plastering is required as their shape is the same and it also offers a better durability has also established itself a strong hold brick.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> </span></p>

</ul>
<p><b>What are the common properties of bricks?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main properties of bricks are thermal, mechanical, durable, and physical properties. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Physical properties of brick</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical properties of brick include size, shape, colour, and density. Let&#8217;s check out this in detail:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) Size</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same country, the size of brick used in construction varies from place to place and country to country. </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paver blocks in India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggests that an ideal brick will have a standard size of 19×9×9 cm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) Shape</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricks generally have well defined and sharp edges. Usually, an ideal brick has a rectangular shape. While making </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block mold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the surface of bricks is regular and even. However special purpose bricks can be either cut or manufactured in many other shapes. Generally, these are the modifications of rectangular shapes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(iii) Colour</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> color mixer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> red is the most common colour of building bricks. Sometimes variations may occur from deep red to light red to purple and buff. Over burnt bricks are recognized by very dark shades and also yellow colour indicates under burning.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(iv) Density</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending upon the used clay type and the method of brick moulding like stiff-mud, hard-pressed, soft-mud etc the density varies.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mechanical properties of bricks</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexure strength and comprehensive strength of bricks are included in this category. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) The comprehensive strength of brick</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When bricks are used in load-bearing walls this is the most important property. The degree of burning and composition of clay is the determining factor of comprehensive strength. While considering load-bearing walls this is the most important properties of bricks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii)  Flexure Strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We usually say that common building brick shall not be less than 10 kg/cm2 because bricks are used in situations where bending loads are possible in a building. Bricks hold sufficient strength against oblique loads.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-05.jpg" alt="plastic moulds for interlocking tiles" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Thermal properties of bricks</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than strong and hard an ideal brick also provide an adequate insulation against cold, noise, and heat. Density and porosity are directly proportional to heat and sound conductivity of bricks. Since heavy and dense bricks conduct sound and heat at a greater rate they have a poor acoustic and thermal insulation qualities. All for this we suggests that bricks should be of enough strength, light-weight, and possess adequate insulation. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Durability of bricks</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durability decides the maximum time in which bricks remain unaltered and strong when used in construction.</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Automatic brick making</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also quite popular nowadays because experience has been proved that properly manufactured bricks are the most durable form of the material of construction, that is they remain for hundreds of years. Durability mainly depends on efflorescence, absorption value, frost resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(i) Absorption value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absorption value is completely related to the porosity of the brick. Actually, porosity is the ratio of the volume of pores to the volume of gross of the sample of the substance. Mainly this absorption characteristic of bricks affects their quality in many ways. They are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the porosity is high the material becomes less solid, hence the strength will be reduced.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water-related defects like frost-action and efflorescence are the outcome of higher absorption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will also lead to deeper penetration of water which in turn will lead to dampness. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ii) Frost Resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frost action is a common phenomenon in cold climate, this is because bricks are quite porous materials. So that it should be protected in areas having rain to minimize absorption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(iii) Efflorescence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In humid and hot climates contorting and a withering process of bricks is a common process. The surface of bricks get covered with grey or white patches of salts and these are present in the original brick clay. Salts get easily dissolved when rainwater penetrates into the bricks. Evaporation starts soon after the rain. Along with water the salt move out and form thin encrustations on the bricks surface. Sulphates of calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are the common salts precipitated during efflorescence. This is the reason why great emphasis is laid while testing the chemical composition of the clay for the </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">block paving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of brick manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bricks are the only type of construction building that provides you to shape them according to your wants, you won&#8217;t have to buy more materials and waste the left over. So if you have plans to construct something you wish according to your design, I suggest you to try bricks as per your construction material with the strong </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brick moulds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from JR Rubbers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houses have transformed from being just a roof to the identity of those who live in it, how well maintained and beautiful these house are, it will help you understand the person who lives in it. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/">floor tiles</a>, <a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/">wall tiles</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parking tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your car porch can give others a glimpse of your lifestyle. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a backyard or some free space in your home can look a bit odd and may affect the beauty of your house. Here&#8217;s where concrete stones can build you a beautiful sidewalk, patio or even a good-looking driveway </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being more colorful then brick and more durable than asphalt, </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concrete paving stone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s come at a cheaper rate as well. </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concrete kerb stones </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">are most used, as they have a durability and quality that stays long with you.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg" alt="rubber paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are mostly two types of concrete pavers, interlocking and architectural.</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Interlocking paver blocks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer you a better result they are more durable and strong every time, no matter what situation or climate, they stay attached. While architectural paver blocks they are thinner compared to their interlocking kin pavers, they cant stand heavyweights so are avoided by more clients. </span></p>
<p><strong>Interlocking Pavers. </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better uniform joint is stiff because its made of concrete mix and good for all use including driveways. </span></p>
<p><strong>Architectural pavers.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It has no edge space, molded from wetter concrete to resemble stone and is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi purposeful, neither can be used for driveways. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interlocking concrete pavers offer a lifetime of durability for your project, it provides you with a long-time service. They can be used anywhere at any time, runways, patios, outside and inside your house also, they are stylish enough to keep your house an eye candy for a long time.All the maintenance you would need is just sweeping or cleaning them once in a week, which shows they are easy to maintain.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-165 size-large" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0589-768x1024.jpg" alt="paver productions" width="525" height="700" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0589-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0589-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG-20180620-WA0589.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the pros of concrete pavers </span></p>
<p><strong>1.Easy installation </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the introduction of <a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines">paver block machine in India</a>, its easy to install your concrete pavers by yourself, if you have a project that is small in size I suggest you install the pavers yourself and if the project is big take help from the professionals. It helps you save time and money.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2.Slip-resistant</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once rainy season arrives, your yard tiles turn into water park with all the water and slippery. Concrete pavers provide you with a slip-resistant flooring for your safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>3.Resilience</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike asphalt or poured concrete pavers, Concrete paver blocks provide you with the resilience that can help you fix the broken ones easily. Concrete pavers don&#8217;t really break allot unless something really heavy falls on them, even if they break all you have to do is take it out, then fix or replace the broken one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4.Water resistance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember the way you used to swipe your tile each time it got wet that will never happen with a concrete paver block. If the concrete paver block is branded and suits the high level in the durability test,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can make sure that you paver block would be water resistant, all you have to do is ask or check while buying you concrete paver block.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-05.jpg" alt="plastic moulds for interlocking tiles" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5.Low cost</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to other flooring accessories, concrete paving is found to be more effective and less expensive. They provide you with a better and durable flooring in a cheaper price, which is a reason why concrete paving blocks are found to be in high demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>6.Many Shapes and designs</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concrete paver blocks provide you with more option in designs and shapes for your paver project. Which actually is good unlike other options in floor accessories you find yourself with more options and better ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some of the benefits of having a concrete paver block as an option in your floor accessories.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com">interlocking paver block</a>s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are strong and durable for a long period of time, they may have certain cons or problems in them in the future that is in 5-6 years. If you are using wood, stone or tile as an option for your</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> floor tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then I am sure that you will find a defect every now and then for these type of decorative accessories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the case of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com">pavement</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problems only occur very rarely, and with solutions like </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interlocking paver molds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or better quality of </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paver block designs </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">all these problems can be easily dogged or solved in the mere future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems and solution for old paver blocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)Weed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s impossible for weeds to grow under paver blocks, as the soil and other factors like sunlight and water is impossible to reach under, but however after a period of time, the weed seeds can adore at the sides of the paver blocks, as after a period of time of 5-6 years, these joints start to create flow between them, which results in weed growth.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg" alt="rubber paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s day there are sand stabilizing compounds and polymeric materials available in the modern construction market that can provide with a better joint for your pavement and if you appoint an expert constructor like JR Rubbers, your paver blocks will remain strong for a long period of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)Mispositioned </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use pavers as a </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parking tiles </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">option, you might find out many paver blocks are stepped in or either has gotten loose, due to the weight and the frequent movement of your vehicle on them, which can result in a very annoying design and the noise is unbearable.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-159" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/54.jpg" alt="pvc tiles manufacturer india" width="1137" height="640" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/54.jpg 1137w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/54-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/54-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/54-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1137px) 100vw, 1137px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays contractors who take up the construction of the driveway with paver blocks, know how important these paver blocks are and what significance they have. Contractors make sure that they dig right and sufficiently for your pavements foundation so that they can be used for a long period of time. The use of better quality and durable paver blocks are available in the market, the use of strong paver blocks can provide you with the least chance of a mismatch or mispositioning of paver blocks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3)Ants </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like other problems are natural, this is a natures creature who provides us with a problem. Old paver blocks often are seen to be with an ant whole or with an ant kingdom on them. Which is considered to be ugly, with all the sand and ants running around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above all the new sand stabilizing and polymeric sand, can not only provide you with a better chance to have a strong joint but can also provide you with a better chance to keep the ants out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4)Tire marks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having tire marks on your paver design can be artistic if you like to have a busy or race car design for your paver block. The tire marks are those stains that remain on your paver block due to the frequent use of your car or due to harsh parking people do on your pavement.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-05.jpg" alt="plastic moulds for interlocking tiles" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring is considered to be the rebirth of all those trees and flower’s who lost their blooming capability during the winters. Spring provide those plants and trees a chance to bloom again, so how does a beautiful season like this affect your</span><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pavement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well before the introduction of interlocking </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/">paver forms</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there used to be a certain gap between the pavers in their foundation. These gaps during the spring season allow these weeds and grass samples to grow between them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As now paver blocks are used as</span><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> floor tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parking tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, weed or grass growing from them won’t look neat or clean in fact, many people wish to avoid such a factor on their paver blocks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following are the tips to provide you with a well maintained paver block’s during the spring season.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg" alt="rubber paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1)Inspect paver blocks</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can always inspect your paver blocks from time to time, have you noticed due to the lack of proper construction or avoiding the use of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/">interlocking paver blocks</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a period of time you start to notice certain gaps between your paver blocks, which will indeed increase in a matter of time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These gaps can prove to be a real problem for your paver blocks during spring, from these gapes the weed and grass would grow. So if you maintain them or keep an eye on your paver block by facing them you would have a weed or grass free paver design during spring. One must find the reason why there are these gaps, sometimes due to the improper construction or due to seasonal change these gaps may occur. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2)Deformation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deformation is a problem faced by many paver owners, who say that their design does not have a strong foundation or often tend to split break. Paver blocks that have no strong foundation do have a lot of gaps between them which tends to increase your chances to find substances like weed, grass or plants on your pavement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid deformation you have to make sure that you start with a good construction at the first point of your pavement. A proper layout, the design, the base layout you set and the quality of layout you use, these all factors can provide you with a better chance to avoid deformation in future.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you avoided the above ideas while constructing your paveblock, don&#8217;t worry, paver blocks are so flexible that they can provide you with the same deformation precautions even after the paver blocks are laid.With the introduction of </span><a href="http://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interlock paving moulds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the industry, problems like deformation has become less. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FB-AD-Banner-05.jpg" alt="plastic moulds for interlocking tiles" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Stains</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your pavement is always stain free, you might have dropped some paint, juice or food on your paver, ignoring those stains can prove to be a big problem. As these stains may result in birth of fungus or other problems on your paver block. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So make sure that you go through these stains and marks clean them properly as it can provide you with a clean and problem free paver blocks.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4)Sealing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid problems for your pavement during the spring season, you can opt for sealing if you wish to have a better glow and grip for your paver blocks. Although paver blocks are considered to have very low maintenance cost, but providing sealing to your paver block once in 2 years won’t do much harm to your budget, will it? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5)Joint sand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, after a period of time there would be some gaps visible on your paver block these blocks would result in weed or grass formation on your paver block. When air, water and sunlight get through these gaps, then only this occurs. Joint sand filled in these gaps can provide you with a better chance to stop plant formation or any other problem. Once joint sand is placed in a paver gap, this will result in the joints of paver to get more strong and durable.      </span></p>
