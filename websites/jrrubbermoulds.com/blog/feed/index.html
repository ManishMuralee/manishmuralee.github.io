<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>WHAT ARE PAVERS?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A paver is something that is commonly used as external flooring. They are usually made of concrete and is a brick-like piece. To make pavers, you mix concrete with some colouring agent and put it into a mould so it can be set and made into a certain shape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright wp-image-600 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/interlocking-brick-mould.png" alt="interlocking brick mould" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/interlocking-brick-mould.png 1200w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/interlocking-brick-mould-300x157.png 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/interlocking-brick-mould-768x402.png 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/interlocking-brick-mould-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavers are mostly used for walkways and outdoor platforms which is why it is commonly known as external flooring. There are different types of pavers that are used in construction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavers are not something that your guests would normally tend to notice. The designs of your pavers are not paid much attention to.  But, pavers do play a very important role in the setting of your house. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are usually used outside residential houses or commercial buildings. Most people use pavers for their parking lots. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavers usually help as it avoids the chipping of the surface and it makes it smooth and safe for people to walk about. This is why pavers are mostly used.</span></p>
<p><b>HERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR YOU TO INSTALL PAVERS</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b> Value of your home.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many time, real estate agents have suggested that when compared to homes that have ordinary concrete driveways, people prefer paved driveways as they look much neater. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also adds value as it is much smoother for people to walk through. They usually tend to prefer interlocking paves over any other.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-420 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg" alt="paver mould making machine" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Durable.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavements are a very durable way of going about your driveway as they are resistant and hence cost effective. They can withstand any weather and also in case an earthquake or an erosion takes place. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially with interlocking pavers, they avoid movement taking place and they also accommodate weight which makes them much better than any other type of paver.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Drainage.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pavers generally tend to have gaps between them. Especially while using brick pavers, they provide good drainage during heavy rains and floods. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They seep in the water between the gaps and do not let water stay on the surface for long. If water stays on the surface, then that would attract mosquitoes too. It could also make your driveway slippery.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignright wp-image-419 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg" alt="color oxide in algeria" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Benefits of a brick paver.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavers tend to beautify your driveway and adds that extra unnoticeable spark to your home/office. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the fact that it looks good, when you use brick pavers you can immediately run heavy machinery over it. So in a couple of days, you can drive over the pavers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not possible when you use any paver other than brick paver.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Environmentally friendly.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pavers are suggested to be an eco-friendly concept as when they drain in the water, beneficial bacteria remove unwanted toxins before they reach the beaches and the bay. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using concrete or asphalt, rainwater tends to mix with various chemicals and with oil and goes into storm drains. In contrast to that, use the interlocking paving systems which will trap the oil and let the water seep out.  </span></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-341 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg" alt="rubber paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/FB-AD-Banner-01-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Easy to replace.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driveways are easier to replace when they are constructed with pavers as if there is any damage, then only the required pavers need to be removed and replaced. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing concrete and asphalt is much more difficult and when it is done, it might look bad. With pavers, you wouldn’t even know when the damaged one is removed and replaced. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With pavers, multiple colours, sizes, shapes, and textures are available. It provides you with an unlimited artistic style as you can create it however you want. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is important to keep in mind that the thickness of the pavers should be according to its usage. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different requirements have different thickness of pavers. Compared to walkways, a driveway would require a different thickness altogether.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JR Rubber Industries are the pioneers in the industry of manufacturing <span style="color: #008000;"><strong><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moulds for pavers</a></strong></span>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good paving can go a long way into a successful business deal. Although seemingly insignificant, it has a lot of influence on your business. Build your pavements now with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JR Rubbers</a></strong></span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of reasons as to why you need to beautify your commercial property. A good pavement can leave your customer feeling happy about your business. He will not be annoyed at the lack of parking or poorly maintained paving. Who wouldn&#8217;t enjoy even smooth parking on their way to work?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all roots down to the customer and keeping him as satisfied as possible. If your customer finds your building pavements to be burdensome with a lot of potholes, chances are he is already frustrated before entering the building. Moreover, uneven parking is, in fact, hazardous for pedestrians! But the good news is, you have a lot of </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver block designs</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to choose from.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how do you know which </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rubber paving mould</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is good for you? Should you use </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic paver moulds</a>?</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What paving is ideal for your business?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these are the questions bothering you, then we assure you have come to the right place.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, you need to consider the fact that commercial settlements can be very different from businesses, and therefore you need to choose your pavement accordingly. Their look and style are completely different from what you see in residential homes. Their use is also much heavier.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pavements are added to your commercial area, it automatically lifts the spirit of the place and makes it look much grander. The place tends to look more extensive and spacious.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also relatively much easier to reconstruct broken paving than to rebuild it from scratch. Depending on the type of commercial space, we provide you with a variety of moulds to choose from.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much importance is given to the designing of interiors, it is equally important to be putting effort for the outdoors as well. It’s these little things that decide the fate of a good business. Thus installation of commercial pavements is an excellent choice.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-420 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg" alt="paver mould making machine" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><b>MATERIALS FOR PAVEMENTS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to paving plans, there are a lot of materials that come into your choice. These could depend on the quality you expect and the application of use.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Asphalt.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asphalt is a product of modern innovation and goes back a long long time. Asphalts make a very sustainable solution to long-standing pavers. Asphalt is reusable and recyclable and thus makes an excellent eco-friendly product. So asphalt is not only durable but also planet-friendly. If laid properly, asphalt will easily last about 35 years and is also very cost-effective. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Plastic.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the construction of flexible pavements, plastic showed a more promising quality. The molten plastic showed excellent binding properties and is a modern solution to pavements and construction of roads. The use of plastic bags for carrying bags, toys etc. are constantly increasing, and modifying the usage of plastics into something sustainable can prove to be an excellent choice.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-412 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg" alt="plastic mould for paver tiles" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Rubber. </b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycled tyre rubbers can be used as an excellent mould. The benefits of these rubber modified asphalts are only starting to get recognized. In many instances, it enhances the performance of these pavers. Rubber overcomes a lot of problems with traditional pavement options. Rubber is a low impact technology that is extremely durable.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the most well-designed pavements are susceptible to some level of damage. It is always important to keep in mind the environmental forces that may affect. The local pavement contractors can provide some insight into the selection of the best pavement for your commercial surrounding. Pavement can sometimes leave cracks and crevices.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These can be controlled by crack filling. If properly done, crack filling prevents the water from seeping in through these cracking and widening them. This lasts at least about 3 years if done correctly.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The next method is called Crack sealing, which is a step further from crack filling for long lasting measures. Materials used for the same can be rubber or asphalt. The right product can only be used depending on the climate of that place. Covering the rubberized crack seal material on top of the crack will complete the crack seal process.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asphalt coating is slightly newer to the industry. They have lesser risks of skin burning or irritation.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in the southern state of Kerala, JR Rubber Industries works with 28 other countries worldwide in the field of manufacturing moulds for concrete pavers. We also engage in manufacturing </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plastic paver moulds</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that last much longer and are also made of recycled plastic material. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We manufacture moulds for different surfaces and situations including </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parking tile moulds</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a variety of </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver block designs</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, JR Rubber Industries are the pioneers of the industry. </span></p>
<h3><b>WHO IS A PAVING CONTRACTOR?</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From working on constructing paved surfaces for roads and houses and other small to large projects, paving contractors are hired to construct such surfaces and to work on existing ones that require repair. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most paving companies make it a point to mention that they specialize in either residential or commercial paving. They use large equipment’s to complete the paving process – some might use excavators to lay out the land before the paving is done and some might use paving machines to place the tiles. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes they also use tamping machines which are mostly for flattening the surface.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-420 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg" alt="paver mould making machine" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><b>Why do you require a paving constructor?</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small paving jobs can usually be done by yourself but otherwise, for large scale projects, you will need the help of a paving contractor. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not only because of the fact that large scale projects are for experienced contractors, but it&#8217;s also because they have access to better types of machinery that would help the process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While choosing what type and material to be used for the pavers, several things need to be kept in mind. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While choosing the design of the tile, you need to be sure of the tile design that you pick so that specific </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile moulds</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be used to construct them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the scenario, make sure you choose the right material for the tiles. The better tiles need not always be the more expensive ones either. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-584 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tile-moulds.png" alt="tile moulds" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tile-moulds.png 1200w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tile-moulds-300x157.png 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tile-moulds-768x402.png 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tile-moulds-1024x536.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3><b>5 QUESTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO ASK YOUR PAVING CONTRACTOR</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask them for how long they have been a paving contractor and some examples of their previous work.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a company has been functioning for quite some time now, it does not always have to mean that their work is perfect. But it is a point that if they have been in business for a while now, then their work might be good enough for them to last so long. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also important that other factors are looked into before you trust the contractor. You can also ask him for some previous work that they have done. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask their former clients how their experience was after hiring these contractors and also try and see the work that they’ve done before.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Make sure that they are insured.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask and confirm if the contractors you are hiring are insured. If not, then any sort of damages that are caused to your property by the contractor would be at your expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you hire your contractors, ask for proof of insurance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that they have public liability insurance and workers compensation insurance. Public liability insurance covers any third party liabilities out of the premises and any legal costs that arise out of it.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/pvc-moulds/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-411 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg" alt="pvc paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask the contractor for the total estimate.</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important that you ask your contractor for some details about your final payment. Your contractor should be able to give you proper details of the final amount that you ought to pay him and not just an estimate. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He should also inform you of any additional payments as no payments should come as a surprise to you later.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Details in the scope of work document</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a document that is basically an agreement on the work that is going to be performed in the project. It&#8217;s basically an understanding of the scope of the entire project. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are collecting bids from multiple organizations, it is possible that you get confused because certain companies do not provide a proper detailed scope of work document. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So make sure that you choose the right company with a detailed scope of work document.</span><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Try to find references you can call and contact</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You needn&#8217;t believe everything a contractor tells you about his work. He is only going to let you know about the positives and not the negatives. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">So try and get some good references that you can contact. These references could be some previous clients. If clients have good feedback about the company, then there&#8217;s nothing to worry about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always keep in mind that the right contractor must be chosen for the right work. JR Rubber Industries provides you with the right kind of moulds for tiles for your project. We can ensure that you get the right service from the best consultants and manufacturers of paving block machinery and moulds.</span></p>

We also provide you with custom-made pavers for your requirements.</span></p>
<p><b>USE OF PAVERS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pavers are used in many scenarios. Pavers are mostly used as external flooring. They are mostly used for outdoor pavements in many parts of homes and commercial buildings. The most common uses of pavers are in driveways, walkways and even pool decks. Pavers are constructed in different colours and textures. They can be removed and re-installed whenever and hence that is the best application of pavers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-418 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><b>DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAVERS</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Brick Pavers.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brick pavers have been used as surfaces for driveways mostly for years now. Brick pavers can be manufactured in several shapes and can be made into a range of colours. Brick pavers are usually made of natural materials and hence can be cleaned and reused which also makes it eco-friendly. It can be manufactured in colours and textures that you want and placed accordingly. Some disadvantages of brick pavers are that they aren’t very cost efficient. They require regular maintenance and can tend to chip off. The reason to which brick pavers are not very beneficial is that they are very fragile.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Concrete Pavers.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concrete pavers are usually used as a flooring technique for driveways and walkways. The advantages of concrete pavers are that it gives a very natural look and it can be customized with the colours and shapes that you want. Another benefit of pavers is that it is cost-efficient and can be installed easily. Raw materials that are of low cost are used mostly as it is cheaper than using bricks. But also keep in mind that when artificial pigments are used, it can fade away quickly. Since raw materials are used, they can also not last long.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><b><b>Rubber Pavers.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest advantage of rubber pavers is that it is eco-friendly. It is recyclable and hence it is also considered to be cost friendly and efficient. But the disadvantage is that if the pavers get wet, then too much heat is absorbed which is not good for the pavers. Wet pavers tend to expand. But it is not very prone to cracking.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Plastic Pavers.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name suggests, these pavers are made of plastic. The plastic that is used to make these pavers are either new or reused plastic. But it is most beneficial if companies make use of recyclable plastic as that would remove the plastic waste in the economy. But the process of recycling is not very easy and hence it might be very expensive. This type of paper is used by many but it is not considered to be as durable as stone pavers.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><b><b>Stone Pavers.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stone pavers are slightly more different when compared to the other types of pavers. Stone pavers are different as they are not uniform like the other pavers. They are directly cut from quarries and used, unlike the others. The other pavers are moulded and manufactured. Hence the pavers tend to be identical. For stone pavers, they are not uniform and there is a variation in the size, colour, and texture.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Marble.</b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These pavers provide a sense of elegance and beauty to the flooring. They are manufactured when limestones are exposed to a certain temperature. It gives a sophisticated and natural look to the driveways or walkways of your home or commercial area. They may cause discolouration quickly and as marble is a great conductor of heat, the floor also tends to absorb more heat especially during the summer time. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pavers come in different colours – Beige, Brown, Grey, and Red are the most popular colours used for pavers. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also come in different shapes and textures according to your requirements. When you plan on installing pavers, use the right kind of pavers after checking out the features of all the different types of pavers. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</span></p>
<p><b>ADVANTAGES OF BRICK PAVING</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different types of paving materials available and you can choose the right one according to your requirements. But here are just a few advantages to brick paving as compared to the other paving methods</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Eco-friendly.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of eco-friendly comes out of the fact that the brick pavers are made of clay. Hence it brings out the natural concept which also means that the colours will last longer and it is more cost efficient. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Installation time.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not take much time to install brick pavers and hence that saves a lot of time especially if you’re busy with construction. Brick pavers can be constructed in any weather and at any time and it can be quickly installed so it not only saves time, but it also works around a budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/pvc-moulds/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-411 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg" alt="pvc paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Retains colour.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another benefit of using brick paving is that no artificial colours are used. Only the natural colour of clay is used for paving and hence the bricks retain this colour and they don&#8217;t lose the colour. It does not fade out and the rich and natural colours remain.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Durability.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another advantage of the brick pavers is the fact that it is durable. They have high resistance and even if huge vehicles are to run over it, it is not fragile and it does not crack very fast. It has the ability to withstand the weight of huge vehicles and it hence known to be the strongest material.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, people have been discovering the feasibility relating to cost and durability when it comes to brick paving. With the use of innovation, they have changed the dull and boring concept of bricks into an elegant one. There is now a shift in the way people perceive brick walls and driveways. It’s considered to be both antique and beautiful.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b><b>Grey and Black bricks.<br />
</b></b></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You might have witnessed this combination on brick walls or in the driveways of homes. It provides a sense of elegance and antique to your home. The concept of antique has recently come out and now you find them in many homes. The grey and black combination is used to dramatize or bring a moody shade to your home.<br />
<b><br />
</b></p>

This helps you use natural means to create a personalized setup in your garden. You can use old bricks that are lying around to build seating and tables and even fire pits in your garden. It would make it look beautiful and you can also invite your friends to your garden to sit and have a cup of tea.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Different colours and shapes.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recent trend revolves around the fact that bricks can be in any colour and shape. So by placing bricks of contrasting colours and quirky shapes beside each other, it brings in a sense of casualness to your home which some people tend to like. This is a new and upcoming trend in homes.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Feature Walls.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art of using feature walls is a very antique concept. Just a single wall filled with bricks of the same size and the same brick colour is an absolute favourite when it comes to brick wall trends. In the world of interior design, this is a concept that is frequently used.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Patchwork effects.<br />
</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when each patch of the building shows a particular colour and shape and different patches have particular shapes and colours. it is literally a patchwork idea as it&#8217;s very messy work that is done which ultimately tends to look classy. You find many examples of these in many homes.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Choosing the right pavement design for your outdoor living space can be tricky and plays a significant role to improve the curb appeal of your house. We fail to realize that the driveway leading to our home is as important as our interiors and it often ends up taking a backseat. Right <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver block design</a></strong></span>s can definitely play an important role in enhancing the beauty of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you are looking for a drive away space, for backyard, pool area, there is a large variety of paving materials, pavement designs and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>colours</strong></span> to choose from. Read more to know how you can enhance the look and add character to your homes by choosing the right <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pavement</a></strong></span> designs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is definitely no standard rule for choosing the right paver designs for your <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">home</span></strong> as it all boils down to your personal preferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But most of us, who are building our homes for the first time may be completely clueless on where to start, what are the available options and designs. Above all, how to communicate what you are looking for to your designer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, let’s talk about some of the tips on how to come to an informed decision considering all the available choices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h4>Look around to gather some ideas and inspiration</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don’t realize what we want until we see it. Hence, start collecting more ideas by taking a walk or drive around the neighbourhoods, go through the home decor magazines, look for online pictures and watch YouTube videos. Save the images and you can show them to the designer for better understanding.</p>
<h4>Consider the look you want to achieve</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After collecting the ideas, ask yourself, what do you like the most? how do you want your pavements to look and feel like? Do you want a rustic look? Muted hues? Or the area to be more vibrant and colourful? Or an elegant textured and well arranged monochrome stones? Or a combination of dark and light colours?</p>
<h4>Know what matches your home</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not necessary that the pavers should match the home colour exactly, but it would be better to go with similar shades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also a good <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>idea</strong></span> to consider your roof colour, that way it helps tie together your home’s overall look.</p>

<h4>The colour, texture and the pattern</h4>
<h6><span style="color: #ff0000;">Colour</span></h6>
<p>Pavers comes in varieties of colours. Some of the widely popular colours in pavers are red, grey, charcoal, buff, black, brick red, white, yellow, green etc. You can go with monochrome, a mixture of different colours, mix and match with random colours. You can also consider contrasting your pavers with the fence, house bricks etc.</p>
<h6>Texture</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main goal while choosing a particular texture is to have that finish, which complements the other materials used in the landscape. It could range from the aesthetics of your hardscape like smooth to drum rolled to give an aged look or an old world feel. Some pavers give the look of a natural cut stone. Some of the newly developed pavers have several joints, making it appear like multiple smaller pieces.</p>
<h6>Pattern</h6>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Typically, there’s a particular look and feel that you want to achieve in an area, that can be successfully achieved by the laying pattern of the pavement surface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paver patterns are highly similar to the brick patterns and other coloured concrete products. Pavers can be laid in varying patterns like circular, neatly stacked, fan shaped, running bond, or that resembling basket weave etc.</p>
<p>Some of the perfect <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver block designs in India</a></strong></span> to consider for your home,</p>
<ul>
<li>Concrete <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>paver blocks</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the common option as it provides a hard surface which is aesthetically pleasing, comfortable to walk on, and are extremely durable.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interlocking paver blocks</a></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These blocks lock into each other like the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle which makes them easy to install without a mortar. It is very easy to remove these blocks and reinstall in case of underground cable or pipe works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brick pavers</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brick pavers are the most environment-friendly option, unlike stone which involves large scale quarrying and freightage. They allow rainwater to permeate into the ground. However, brick can be fragile and prone to breakage.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-412 size-full" src="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg" alt="plastic mould for paver tiles" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Natural stones</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natural stones are more expensive than bricks and concretes. Some of the most commonly used stone materials in India are,</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>Cobblestone</ol>
<ol>Terrazzo</ol>
<ol>Natural sandstone</ol>
<ol>Flagstone</ol>
<ol>
<ol>Kota stones</ol>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Tiles with grass infills</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
If you are a nature person then you should definitely go with this option. Blending concrete stones and other materials with soft grass is definitely a visual treat to the eyes and guaranteed to bring a sense of relaxation, high aesthetic value and also helps to recharge groundwater effectively.</p>

<h3>WHO IS A PAVING CONTRACTOR?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From working on constructing paved surfaces for roads and houses and other small to large projects, paving contractors are hired to construct such surfaces and to work on existing ones that require repair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most paving companies make it a point to mention that they specialize in either residential or commercial paving. They use large equipment to complete the paving process – some might use excavators to lay out the land before the paving is done and some might use paving machines to place the tiles.</p>
<p>Sometimes they also use tamping machines which are mostly for flattening the surface.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Why do you require a paving constructor?</strong></p>
<p>Small paving jobs can usually be done by yourself but otherwise, for large scale projects, you will need the help of a paving contractor.</p>
<p>This is not only because of the fact that large scale projects are for experienced contractors, but it&#8217;s also because they have access to better types of machinery that would help the process.</p>
<p>While choosing what type and material to be used for the pavers, several things need to be kept in mind.</p>
<p>While choosing the design of the tile, you need to be sure of the tile design that you pick so that specific <span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tile moulds</a></strong></span> could be used to construct them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the scenario, make sure you choose the right material for the tiles. The better tiles need not always be the more expensive ones either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/pvc-moulds/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-411 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg" alt="pvc paver moulds" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pvc-paver-moulds0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h3>
5 QUESTIONS THAT YOU NEED TO ASK YOUR PAVING CONSTRUCTOR</h3>
<p><strong>1. Ask them for how long they have been a paving contractor and some examples of their previous work.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a company has been functioning for quite some time now, it does not always have to mean that their work is perfect. But it is a point that if they have been in business for a while now, then their work might be good enough for them to last so long.</p>
<p>It is also important that other factors are looked into before you trust the contractor. You can also ask him for some previous work that they have done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ask their former clients how their experience was after hiring these contractors and also try and see the work that they’ve done before.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make sure that they are insured.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ask and confirm if the contractors you are hiring are insured. If not, then any sort of damages that are caused to your property by the contractor would be at your expense.</p>
<p>When you hire your contractors, ask for proof of insurance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make sure that they have public liability insurance and workers compensation insurance. Public liability insurance covers any third party liabilities out of the premises and any legal costs that arise out of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/plastic-moulds/2"><img class="alignright wp-image-412 " src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg" alt="plastic mould for paver tiles" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plastic-mould-for-paver-tiles0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Ask the contractor for the total estimate.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that you ask your contractor for some details about your final payment. Your contractor should be able to give you proper details of the final amount that you ought to pay him and not just an estimate.</p>
<p>He should also inform you of any additional payments as no payments should come as a surprise to you later.</p>
<p><strong>4. Details in the scope of work document</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a document that is basically an agreement on the work that is going to be performed in the project. It&#8217;s basically an understanding of the scope of the entire project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you are collecting bids from multiple organizations, it is possible that you get confused because certain companies do not provide a proper detailed scope of work document.</p>
<p>So make sure that you chose the right company with a detailed scope of work document.</p>
<p><strong>5. Try to find references you can call and contact</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You needn&#8217;t believe everything a contractor tells you about his work. He is only going to let you know about the positives and not the negatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So try and get some good references that you can contact. These references could be some previous clients. If clients have good feedback about the company, then there&#8217;s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You should always keep in mind that the right contractor must be chosen for the right work. JR Rubber Industries provides you with the right kind of moulds for tiles for your project. We can ensure that you get the right service from the best consultants and manufacturers of paving block machinery and moulds.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you on the run looking for a pavement job for your housing project or building projects for your company? Are you on the stand making enquiries to choose between the pavement options that goes along with your quality plans? Then we must be able to frame your choice on a quick note. Let’s help you with some guidance to keep you updated on the search!</span></p>
<h3>What is your idea of pulling out a characteristic pavement job?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate objective of any pavement job is to finally provide a smooth and flawless surface regardless of the varieties and attractions it exhibits in the texture and designs. The distinctive feature of all building jobs have got to do with its stable outlook and durability. Recent developments among the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paver productions</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that differ in endurance and quality related elements has introduced diverse processing stages that these pavements are subjected to withstand and contain themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the characteristic features of a good pavement work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flawless blending with an existing job. The scenario must be either expansion of pavements or to establish an entirely new job at the location. In both the cases, the overall outcome must integrate immaculate finish.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levelling. This has to do with the expertise required at the stage of laying the pave. An even surface would be expected with the utmost accuracy. The efficiency of the pave considerably depends on the convenience offered on opting different paving process.<br />
<a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/products/rubber-moulds/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-418 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg" alt="rubber paver mould manufacturers" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/rubber-paver-mould-manufacturers0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water drain levelling at the gauge point. Standing water on any surface would always put your job out for maintenance due to damage, until and unless the pre-determined measures have been taken over the job to aid water withstanding features.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Details are up to the mark. standing edges and points always come into attention after the completion of a pavement job. The accuracy and perfection of these areas determines the quality in details of the work.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>YOUR CHOICE DETERMINES YOUR PRODUCTION STANDARDS</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice could be categorised in terms of processing stages as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet caste pavement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry caste pavement</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your selection of these production and processing techniques are based on the job you intend to build on. Both the approaches are favourable as per the job requirements. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are expecting to carry out a seamless finish to your structures or building areas, then you would prefer using wet caste pavement techniques as it is characterised as a flowing mixture on the pre-settling period. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you opt to converge the result of your building structures or jobs towards tenacity and non-porous finish, your choice could ascend towards Dry caste method.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-420 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg" alt="paver mould making machine" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paver-mould-making-machine0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<h3>DRY CASTE PAVEMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This production technique usually refers to the process that involves very less water content in ratio. The output pave is generally characterised by hard, rigid and extremely solid in structure. These comes into preference when expense and budget concerns are raised. They usually represent cheaper processing cost considering normal grade components used along the mixture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process technique comes with an advantage of settling relatively faster than other common techniques. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is usually preferred when the job comprises works like manufacturing concrete blocks and concrete pipes and rings.</span></p>
<h3>WET CASTE PAVEMENT</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This could be the most popular and preferred process that includes the essential mixtures in appropriate proportions that also takes into account the imperative water content ratio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further stages of production includes the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vibrating table</a></strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment to pop out and eliminate the unwanted air bubbles that eventually expands within the settling concrete mix. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final stage of the process technique is carried out by providing significant time for the settling stage after undergoing several curing courses on the go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a highly adopted approach when durability and strength has been added to the requirement board. Nearly all the </span><span style="color: #339966;"><a style="color: #339966;" href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>paver block machines</strong> </span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are fed with proportional water content to follow the wet caste procedures.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/chemicals-oxides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-419 size-full" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg" alt="color oxide in algeria" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A.jpg 1600w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-768x192.jpg 768w, https://www.jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/color-oxide-in-algeria0A-1024x256.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
