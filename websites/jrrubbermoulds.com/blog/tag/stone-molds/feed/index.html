<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High lifestyle has become like one of the most essential need in today&#8217;s community, more people are attracted towards luxury items like car, house, furniture and even the </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">floor tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floor tiles,</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wall tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even the </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parking tiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at their car porch are considered to be a symbol of a rich lifestyle. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interlocking tiles molds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have become the first choice for many individuals who wish to decorate their house from inside and outside. A sense of quality and durability are born while strong paver tiles are used in a house. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the new </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paver block designs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has introduced in the market, has just made builders and people confused as all the paver block design are unique and different, which makes them suitable for many various shapes and can be fixed strong and in an interlocking method. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is some of the</span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paver block</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tiles, those are high in quality and can provide you with a luxury finish:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural Stone Flooring </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other flooring accessories, you can consider natural stone flooring as one of the hardest and durable floorings. But as durable the material is the double it would cost you, as it is heavy enough, you will also have to pay for its transportation cost and once the stone reaches your home, you will have to employ workers to install those stone tiles for you, while installing, if the constructions happen to be underground then you would have to pay extra. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to have a durable and luxurious tile as your flooring accessories then spending more money should not be a problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ceramic floor tiles </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These types of tiles are often preferred by those who wish to acquire a classy and luxurious floor tile. They come in a very limited option like handmade ceramic floor tiles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italian designer tiles, Designers tiles and few more which leaves you with very fewer options, but even the few options that are available are considered to be unique and eye candy indeed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to the cost, the sky&#8217;s the limit. They can cost you really expensive, the better the design the better the quality and price. So do have a hefty budget if you wish to buy these tiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardwood Flooring. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I should have stated upfront, that luxury does mean expensive and this type of flooring is luxurious and rare, so I hope you can assume the price of the hardwood flooring. Imported from the forests of South America and Africa, these wood planks are considered to be one of the most less seen luxury floorings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand Scraped Wood Flooring</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most bought and used flooring accessories, the hand scraped wood flooring is the most used luxury flooring in this list. In the year 2013, this was selected as the most favorite flooring accessories among the rest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t let the hand scraped wood flooring name fool you, as these type of flooring are not hand scraped these days, they never go near the human craftsman at all. The machines scrape the wood out and it&#8217;s the humans who fit those floorings for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpet Tiles</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carpets are some of the cheapest flooring options in the market, Carpet tiles are also considered to be cheap, but when it comes too decorative and designer carpet tiles the workers or contractors would charge you with a much higher charge and provide you with a long lasting carpet material that can provide you with long-term durability. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They come in different colors and designs that make them so unique and special that everyone wishes to have a carpet tile in their home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinyl Tile </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known to be the tile that provides you with a dust or stain-free surface, the vinyl tile has now entered the big market and is competing with all the giant tile. Vinyl tiles unlike other tiles offer a long period of stability with the lowest rate of maintenance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following was the 7 most luxurious tiles you can use for the flooring at your home, and make your home look a bit better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raw materials like rubber, plastic, glass or metal are given different shapes using a mould, this process is known as moulding. A liquid raw material turns into solid when poured into a mould container. To avoid hasty wear and tear these containers are mainly made up of steel.</span></p>
<p><b>What is </b><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><b>Rubber Paver Moulding</b></a><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rubber paver mould manufacturers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make a usable rubber product from untreated rubber or elastomers. On applying pressure on elastomers, they will return to their original shape because they are natural polymers bearing all elastic properties. Not only because of its malleability but also because of its varied utilities in industrial and domestic sectors they are broadly used by </span><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rubber paver mould manufacturers in India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-17-10.png" alt="designer tile in bhrain" width="994" height="327" srcset="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-17-10.png 994w, http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-17-10-300x99.png 300w, http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-17-10-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p><b>How to select rubber material?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubber compounds are of different types, each differs from one another. So for selecting the correct compound, you need to go for a selection process. For  achieving the best performance level following things should be kept in mind while selecting a rubber material:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware with the main function of the part .i.e, whether it will transmit or absorb energy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the material cost per part.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose according to the location i.e, inside or outside.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select the place according to match its temperature requirements.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not expose it to chemicals.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be aware of its physical properties and ensure its regulatory requirements.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What are the different types of rubber moulding?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/">Rubber moulds for paver tiles</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be done in two different forms of moulding, one is injection moulding and the other is compression moulding.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" src="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-16-50-1.png" alt="tile molding" width="1011" height="303" srcset="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-16-50-1.png 1011w, http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-16-50-1-300x90.png 300w, http://jrrubbermoulds.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-2018-07-09-16-16-50-1-768x230.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injection Moulding</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under high pressure heated rubber compound or material is injected into the mould cavity, this process is known as injection rubber moulding.  The molten state material is placed inside the injection barrel. For creating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/">rubber paver moulds</a> in Indonesia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> injection moulding is the most well-versed way.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Injection moulding process.</span></span>&nbsp;
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Into the injection barrel, an unseasonal rubber material in the form of a constant strip is ingested.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) In a temperature controlled barrel it is warmed by an auger screw. Once the rubber material accumulates the auger screw is pulled backward.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) By an injection press, the rubber material is inoculated into the mold cavities once the auger screw moves backward.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4) When the mold is closed under high pressure the auger screw is pushed forward forcing the material into the mold cavities.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5) When the material is cured in the heated mould the auger screw turns again to replace the injection barrel and the injection part is ready for next shot once the mould gets opened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Advantages of Injection moulding</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapid production</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modicum wastage of material</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scheme flexibility</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor labor cost</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resilience in color and material<br />
</span><strong><br />
Compression Moulding</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://jrrubbermoulds.com/">Rubber paver mould manufacturers</a> in Bangalore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">place rubber material in the mould and close it under hydraulic pressure. Once the mould opens, you can remove the part from it or else you can trim the excess rubber from its part. Medium hardness compounds mainly make use of compression moulding. This process reduces the flash produced in rubber moulding process.</span></p>
<p><b>Advantages of compression moulding</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheap tooling cost</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideal for small production</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair for big parts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No more material passage through sprues, runners, gates</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As each and every process of moulding has its own advantages and disadvantages, it is most important to look into all requirements of the product while choosing suitable production.
